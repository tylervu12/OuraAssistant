how's it going everyone so if you've been subscribed to the channel you may have noticed I've been wearing this smart ring throughout my videos and you may be asking yourself why am I doing that if I already own an Apple Watch well a very simple reason it's just it's minimal it's very Compact and this allows me to continue tracking my sleep data my steps my recovery and gets me the freedom to wear an actual traditional analog watch so when I'm dining and stuff I'm actually wearing a proper watch of my choice while continuing to track my Fitness data so in this video I'm going to go ahead and show you the full guide of all the ins and outs and things I want to show you about the aura ring if you're a first-time buyer you're doing research you're potentially thinking about buying this or you already own one here are some tips and tricks I learned throughout the months of owning it so let's start off with the very beginning by moving my phone away and moving any distractions as we're going to cover the  charging puck that's used to charge this ring because this is a size 11 and not one size fits all so for instance you got like something larger like a size 12 mm the charger may not fit properly but the charger is not held together magnetically so if you have a friend or somebody who has like a smaller one like a like a 7 mm or something like that it's not going to work with your ring likely unless it's the exact same size as it simply just drops in and that's basically it and it uses a USBC Port right here which gives you the freom to use any USBC port and so long as your phone supports it technically you can charge from your device and there is a white LED light right here now since this is the Gen 3 Ora ring we have here as soon as this is full this white LED will turn green and some important things you need to know about if you like to maximize the longevity on this non-replaceable battery is don't let this ring fall below 20% or 10% as that is typically The Sweet Spot to maximize your longevity of the smart ring and don't let it charge to 100% on the charger when it's not in use as that is also another way to harm the longevity of the internal battery by doing this you're most likely to easily be able to get anywhere from five to the rated seven days under a single charge so what I typically do I only wear this ring to track my sleep tracking because it's much more comfortable wearing this over a watch so I typically just have it unplugged just like so on my nightstand and I just put it on every night to do the sleep tracking so thanks to know  when wearing this ring it's true it's not really advised to wear this during your gym workouts because I already have like battle marks and stuff on my ring hopefully the camera could focus on that you can kind of see that and the sensors down here they kind of stick out a little bit too much because I find when working out while wearing this while holding like a barbell when dead liftting and stuff like that the sensors actually will actually like press down hard on your finger and leave like these three little bumps right here as you can see so avoid wearing this but there are some cases if you like to prevent it from easily getting scratched up available in the market I'll link some in the description but it's not necessary but one thing for sure is there is a little groove right here this little marker is there to indicate where the sensors are located because it's recommended to wear it like this make sure you see the little divot right here pointing downwards on your finger so for the best data accuracy it's recommended make sure this is pointing downwards another recommendation is to place it on your index finger because this is typically the finger that has the most exposure for all your nerves and stuff your blood vessels and all that good stuff where the sensors are utilizing to gather all this data which is why you see blood oxygen centered markers on typically on the index fingers because regardless on the body fat percentage it has a higher sance of detecting on your index finger a lot easier than your  other fingers but from my experience with the aura ring it's perfectly fine using your ring finger your middle finger if it supports it and even like your thumb but the best way to finger out which is the best comfortable finger just to do this and whichever finger you see a bigger Gap that's basically the finger in my opinion that will give you the most comfort so in our case there's a gap between my middle finger and my index finger so I find the best result for me for comfort is the middle finger because it is somewhat bulky which is why I highly recommend picking up their ring test kit that they sell online they even sell on a Best Buy as well as Amazon it's only $10 this will give you all the ring size that they have available because if we open it up you'll see see it's all nice and labeled and we have a size 11 and as you compare them it's literally is a one to one copy of each other which is quite awesome this allows you to comfortably fit them before you buy it because throughout the day your finger actually does change size very slightly and you want to find the best one that fits your finger throughout the entire day so I highly advise picking up their little fitting kit and then once you're satisfied with the size they will actually credit you the $10 towards the actual official cause of the ring and then you could use continue using the size for like jewelry as well as I found out which is kind of cool and then this does have a built-in  memory storage as well because there has been times where I left my phone behind I have it on airplane mode or it's just not connected or within range of my phone and my ring the ring actually has built-in storage which is able to easily track up to 2 days from my experience of sleep tracking data once I have access to my smartphone again I just launch the app tap on the ring it will automatically like update you probably saw earlier that blue line I went across that just means it's backing up the storage data that's in the ring onto the app so it's pretty cool it does have built-in memory so you don't have to have your phone around and then if you are a part of the Apple ecosystem with an Apple watch your iPhone and all that good stuff the ring is compatible with the Apple well as the Apple Health app as both the Apple watch and the ring can actually communicate with one another but it is indeed compatible with the Apple ecosystem that was one of my biggest concerns so let's put on this ring and let's go ahead and get started started so starting off with the first  thing you need to do quickly go on the hamburger icon right here and go into your settings because what you have to do is first decide if your units is imperior or Matrix so quickly switch between those two and then in here go into Apple Health if you're on Android it'll probably be Android Health an example but this will be iPhone Focus enable connect to health and save mindful minutes to health because now if we launch the health app all the data that the smart ring has been Gathering will be found and located right here including your sleep so here you go in in detail in REM sleep awake core and deep sleep right here and also will keep track of your highlights and yes it does track your heart rate and the ring can also track your blood oxygen level you just have to go in and also enable that  you'll find in the main menu here on your app o didn't mean to do that click on it and where it says blood oxygen sensing enable it but now if we go back and go into settings and go into your membership this is where you monitor your membership for some re I got an error page but I'm going to go oh there  we go now we have it this is where you can log in and actually monitor your membership plan now this ring is not necessary to use the membership but here's a quick rundown with the membership you have access to a lot of things I'm going to show you in a bit but the membership plan does start at $599 you can buy an anual annual plan which is right here which saves you about $2 if if you do decide on doing this but if you're using like your buddy's referral code I'll link my referral code too if you don't have access to it it will give you a discount on the ring as well as give you a free monthly membership as well or a six month membership depending on the promotion that's running out time making this video so I highly recommend if you're pick planning on picking one up use somebody's referral link if you can if you don't have one again mine will be down there optional you don't have to use it but it will support the channel if you do but if you decide on not g the membership you will still have access to some of the important things like like  Readiness your sleep score as well as your activity score which I decided to uh switch to this page apparently there we go but the thing about that is if you don't have a membership notice how I click on it to show me the like the quick break down on so many things like this uh that you won't have access to it so I highly it's highly recommended if you're playing on buying this and you like to see the small details like respiratory rates and such or body temperature the membership is what gives you access to this without it all you have access to is this 81 score and you can't go back and see your previous days or your months type of thing it's just the day off which in my opinion will kind of make this a ring kind of pointless but out of all the smart rings I tested like the Samsung ring and stuff like this this still needs work out of all the Rings this is super accurate almost on par in terms of its accuracy like something like an Apple Watch so without subscription this thing is trash if I'll be purposely honest with you now let's talk about the overview of the app so this is your homepage P it's going to  have a couple of like Windows right here like understand more about your cardiovascular health your Readiness your sleep tracking score rating activity goals your goal is will start outdoor workout with heart rate monitoring from The Ring itself your stress levels your heart rate and in the heart rate window right here if you tap  on the low heart rate it will actually continue reading the heart rate level right there in real time all utilizing the internal sensors from this ring and then end it just like that and if you keep going down it also will monitor your recommended bedtime and in the explore tab this is where you find a lot of cool Nifty Things in the explore tab  you can start like medication a breathe exercise a sleep or learn more about the watch in medication if you tap play this will actually play like an audio log hey friends it's Jeremy today's meditation I intend to help you if you're feeling and to basically help you meditate basically and think you choose your rating and it also will continue playing like soothing noise in the background as well but you have stress and sleep to help prep you to sleep on a stress day as well as audio logs for breathe exercises and sleep with sleep you could just hit play this is Orin make incred make as little effort as possible basically guidance to get you help you get the best night good night's sleep really interesting stuff and on the very top you can also categorize it by by awake rest unw for sleep as well as in sleep also categorize it by meditation or stories so like help you fall asleep as well you can tap learn to play like little video guides on how certain things work on this app as well but you're watching this video I think this is a little bit easier because these videos take a little bit longer if we go back in daytime stress you go to play here you'll find a suggestion for some of these like sessions I was showing you earlier and then depending on the category that you decided to do like meditate in our case you'll see the summary here and this also gives you the freedom to delete some of these sessions if you don't want to be a part of your data not a plus is kind of like your  shortcuts here you could actually do an unguided session by selecting unguided session and you can select the time this will utilize all the sensors that this ring has because if you do this you'll see that'll monitor your heart rate for 1 minute or depending on the timer you could do 3 minutes which will be enough data to gather your heart rate as well as your HRV average and 5 minutes this will include your skin temperature as well and if you keep going down basically you could keep it all the way down to like open end and even explained to you right here when your average heart rate will be available for 3 minutes and then your skin temperature after 5 minutes as I was showing you earlier and then depending on what happened you could add tags right here so if you had some alcohol during this day or you were stressed doing like baby care service you could also search it up right here so actually tag some of these categories that you were recently doing on these recent activities so if you look back and your numbers are kind of weird it's like oh you look back in the tag you added and it's like oh I was babysitting so I must have been stressed or you could actually act activate like an open workout as well so here you can do strength training elliptical walking or more workouts it will give you access to all these categories and if it's an outdoor activity like cycling it will actually include your phone's GPS data as well and here you can set the duration as well as the intensity if it was hard easy moderate and you know so for GPS I did forget to actually tell  show you something if we go back into our settings in GPS and location permissions make sure you have Aura location feature enabled just keep in mind when you have this enabled this app will constantly use your GPS data as well as battery resources so if you find yourself not being close to a charger as most much as possible you may want to consider disabling this in general and then just remember to go back and enable these if you're relying on this for your workout tracking but modart SM watches typically have a built-in GPS built in so it doesn't have to utilize your phone's resources now out of here in the Readiness this will be able where you can see your like overall Readiness  recovery score your average heart rate your resting heart rate body temperature sleep basically we'll summarize it all for you right there but if you keep going down you can see additional details and then you can skim between the different days as well and then in sleep tracking this is where you go see  the whole detail entire Det details of your total sleep time time in bed sleep efficiency resting rate if you click on it it will give you more additional detail as well and then you can also add tags as well but then you also see Community discoveries because the community with similar data like this will show you what they tagged during these type of data information that they received so liquor was involved flu or diarrhea or no alcohol I didn't had any alcohol I was probably tired that day but down here breaks down more additional information as well as your breathe rate if it'll optimal or not or something to be concerned about but if we keep going down in sleep of course blood oxygen sensor then in the activity tab this is where you can see your total  calorie burn your calorie progress your steps activity score stay active time and training frequency and volume and such like that now I wear my watch at the end only at night so I only use the sleep tracking because again it's just more comfortable than a bulky Apple watch which is why you're probably seeing low scores right here then here on the resilience tab this is where can  monitor your stress level more into detail as well as see your map but since I haven't been using this this ring longer than for quite a while for all day sessions but if we look back during the times when I actually was wearing this daily to gather this data it requires 14 days for to start gathering this data and this will require you to wear this ring daily for you to see your nighttime recovery daytime recovery daytime stress load lo as well as some tips cards right down here and if you tap on open day stress this will also give you the start on like the exact time of the day when you were most stress according to your ring so I will stress around 6:00 p.m. which makes sense this is typically the time when I'm done from work and I'm just wrapping things up and then it just goes down from here so it does monitor your stress level and it also keeps tabs on it as well so I've been stressed for 45 minutes during this day and I restored it in an hour and 4 5 and then if you click on here again you can add those tags I'll show them you way earlier but that's basically the nutshell when it comes to the app overall features up here this little up Arrow share icon this allows you to basically make like a  community like social media post you can change the background with a photo you can take a photo right then and there you include charts like your heart rate and you have other charts right here and then just tap the share button and then you can either save the image to your camera roll so give a permission to do that now if you launch the camera roll on your camera now if we launch the camera roll image that we saved on our photo app here is that shart right there and it could upload on social media your stories or something like that like on Instagram and then next that I share up arrow is your battery information of the ring so this is our current battery rate  you can enter the ring in airplane mode while having airplane mode enabled remember has internal storage so it doesn't have to be reliant on your phone but once you synchronize it all the data that the ring was gathering will automatically be synchronized on your phone there is find my ring feature which will just Mark the last known location it was last connect to your phone and then you'll find some tips and tricks right here including how to transfer data to a new device which I should show go ahead and show you in a little bit and then on the next tab over here where you'll see the nitty greedy detail like show number firware update generation the exact spec of your ring as well as some general tools like soft reset if you know this ring is acting up  funny in the main page over here if you tap on this today icon you'll have access to your calendar so you can backtrack and see how long you've been wearing this ring for and see like a certain day and like how your data was  that's how you have access to that calendar one but if we go into the hamburger Tab and tap on my profile here you could actually adjust like your status your weight change your current goal your sleep movements my sleep at moments on the top here where it says goal in life and situations when you click on here depending on the thing that interests you it'll give you like little pointers on things to improve like your overall health and examp Le it the app will allow you to focus more on that so I'll be optimized for that and then in Trend you can select between different categories to see the details  in your sleep like REM sleep latency deep sleep and all that stuff including Readiness activity stress and Spotlight and more additional data down here so this app really does allow you to get into the ny-g greedy in reports you can see your weekly reports if you like it all summarized right here you can your monthly supports is also available here as well in the experimental tab this will allow you to have access to  upcoming like features so right now I have it enabled for a caffeine so I typically have a coffee in the morning and now it's actually going to be keeping track of my uh caffeine in this caffeine new program that they just launched so experiments just allow you to be introduced to new features that they're planning on adding circles is allow invite your friends so you guys will monitor their sleep activity levels and stuff and you can just tap invite  members to add more people via contact email or text and then on top here you go create new circles if you like to group your friends as well so here you could create a nickname I'm going to call it hotot Tech I'll be appearing as my Instagram handle and I'm going to go ahead and include all this data and then just like that you've created a group and you could invite them right down here but if we go back go back in the hamburger tab you will see a rest mode rest mode is good to enable if you if  you're recovering from like an injury you're ill or you're just busy to like Fitness track your Stu this basically pause your sprs and stuff like that when you enable rest mode in the heart rate you'll just find more information about heart rates and stuff like that L to your heart and such this is honestly placed in like the heart rate sensor section over here on this little tab on one of these so don't be surprised if you see similar Windows oh here it is similar Windows as your Peru in the app compared to this side portion and the blood auction sensor I already showed you how to enable that our labs this gives you access to more experimental  features you could be enrolled in if you like to try some of these out you can I noticed they change that up constantly so I'm not going to go into detail on what they're covering right now because it could be different by the time you you're watching this video and in settings of course we went through all that so another thing about settings is if you're a female you will find a  woman's health section and here you can actually allow it to predict your periods get pregnancy insights so perfect for like mental cycles and such you can able right here for Women's Health but to back up your device just tap back up all my data so if you're  transferring from one iPhone to the other this way just log in and then all the data that you had tracked with your aura ring will continue on the new device so it's good to come back here and manually backup your data again unfortunately there's no automatic option for the back backup data so you have to manually go in here and tap on it that's why I called it manual backup  data it's the only option we have and then on the very bottom of that section was the Integrations this will find support for third party apps if you use some of these third party apps it it's good to know that these apps actually are compatible it end and help just gives you a quick access to like customer support chat with a team member uh and also see like common topics people have like how to charge your ring and stuff like that but since you're watching this video you're more informed than ever how to do that so no need for that and then in the referral friend  this is where you can find the current referral so right now as I will say earlier using somebody's referral link will give you $40 off on your purchase on the new ring of their choice and from my understanding they will still get that one month free promotion so they could get that first month free with this referral link and a $40 discount so again highly recommend using that referral link it's there it's free and I'll have mine in the description if you don't have a friend that has one but there you guys have it that is the full guide of everything there is to know about the aura ring and some cool tips and tricks and some things you definitely need to know before purch ing or if you already own the aura ring thank you so much for watching
