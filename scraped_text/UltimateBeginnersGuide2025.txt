--------------------------------

this is the ultimate beginner guide for the aura ring 4 this is my ring finger by the way you crazy people I'm going to go through all the things that you need to know from using the ring charging it how to wear it to the actual app how it all works the things that you need to go through in the menus to understand that data and how this ring could potentially change your life if you're thinking about buying one links are down below if you click that link it helps support the channel so we can keep making videos like this or you can also go to Best Buy that doesn't support the channel but it's a faster way to get it make sure you get the right size ring I have a video on all the different colors chapter markers for everything are linked down below let's get into the video now how to charge your ring the O  ring comes with the charger that looks like this it's a charging pad and it only works for your size it might you might be able to charge your ring on a ring charger that's one size smaller but it's never going to work up and it won't work for ones that are drastically different and there are notches here that help you line up the ring you can't put the ring on unless it's in the proper position boom slides right on this light will turn on to activate the charging sequence what you do want to do is get a charger plug it in with there USBC cable that comes in thank you Aura for doing USBC to USBC this is the charging pad you can put this by your bedside one thing I do wish which I'll show you in a second is Aura copied Samsung and ringcon which is a charging box this charging box has juice in it and I can close it the ring can charge in my backpack I can toss it around it's totally fine great for travel or I need to build one of these cuz then I can just pop the ring out we're good to go it tells me how much percentage it has on the actual pad itself but where I gave us this if I put the ring on I toss this in my backpack boom the ring will fall off but you want to put the charging ring on you got the light here to denote how much charge it has and it plugs in VI your USBC you can use any USBC Cable in terms of wattage it takes about 2 watts of power as you can see that right there and that's how you charge the ring it's pretty easy leave it on your nightstand I prefer to charge it when it hits to 20% you don't want it to go too low you have battery degradation and after about 2 years maybe even more if you don't properly charge your ring your Ring's battery lifespan will go from like 7 8 days to like 2 days and you have to replace the ring buy a new ring so I just recommend have good charging habits don't let the battery die all the way charge it at 20% and if you really want to be crazy do 20 to 80% keep it within those bounds to have the best long-term battery life now  how to wear the ring so you want to wear the ring on ideally your pointer or your middle finger these are the two best rings to wear it on you can also do your ring finger as well ideally not your pinky or thumb find the ring size that best fits that your rings your fingers I should say are going to change size so throughout the day depending nutrition hydration so I found that the 14 fits best on my pointer finger and I like wearing it here there is a little bit of wiggle room but if you want the best accuracy you want to have the least amount of wig room where it's snug but not too tight and you want to have the notch on the bottom that will get you the best accuracy the new or ring 4 has no bumps so you won't be able to tell where the ring is if you feel the inside on the outside I usually try to feel with my eyes closed and be like there's the notches on the bottom and that will just get you the best accuracy data the looser it is the more likely it is to move around when you're grabbing things but that's the best best case scenario you can swap it around on different fingers it doesn't matter as long as it fits that ring my left hand is thinner in terms of thickness than my right hand so I wear it on my right hand now that  you figured out how to charge it how to wear it how does the app work let's jump into all the data and the overview of the app so we pull up the ordering app here you're going to get the aura logo right at the beginning and this is the home screen it's updated since my last beginner guide if you want to watch that to see how much it's changed but now the dashboard is drastically different you have all your scores at the top ring why is it not connecting readiness sleep activity heart rate live heart rate and then stress which is a new feature you can go ahead and see any activities that were detected and you can go ahead and say hey that was accurate next whatever that is you can go through and do that um I usually ignore these I don't really care too much about it I can see my total step count or calorie burn for the day you can change these based on what you like I put it to the maximum I wish it went higher you can hide calories which I did do that and then you can scroll down see daytime stress your heart rate if you tap this heart it'll actually measure your heart rate just keep your finger still and then a timeline if you tap more you can see your cardiovascular age your heart health which I think it gives you like a V2 Max score mine says high of 45 my Apple watch and garment are closer to 50 I have inactive time my Readiness score my sleep score resilience body clock how well I'm sleeping my bedtime explore timeline and then what's new sympton radar and all that information is on your homepage and then you have menu options on the bottom look shows my heart rate live vitals which will go into your big three scores as well as some extra scores and then my health which is more Trends over time as well as a variety of reports so when it comes to the app that's where you can process most of the information when you wake up I typically open the app I sync the data if you haven't synced it in a while it might take some time to load in the morning so just leave it open and do not let these scores impact how you decide how you feel let how you feel decide and let the data be just another helpful valuable Point big three scores so I'm  going to tap vitals here and I'm going to be able to start with Readiness that's kind of like how quote unquote ready are you for the day we have resting heart rate heart rate variability body temperature respiratory rate I love looking at these four numbers because they have been vetted to be the most accurate on the aura ring so if I'm trying to understand hey am I out of my bounds I will look at this for the most part like on this day I'm way out of my bounds what happened there I don't know for the most part I was pretty consistent I don't look at the small variations only large changes body temperature same thing like right here what happened here October 26 maybe alcohol respiratory rate when I got Co there was a massive Spike we look at large variations not small changes that's interesting to know ready this score overall I can see all the different contributors to that and if I don't understand why it's optimal good or fair you can tap in to see that information and then another thing is heart rate and heart rate variability graphs at the and you have a summary at the top of this Readiness score section here and you can hide all those detailed numbers or you can see that information if you'd like that is the first one of the big three the next big three is  sleep if I scroll down we can see our sleep I can tap the arrow to see more I can see my bedtime my wake time Total Sleep time in bed sleep stages average oxygen s satation and I can go ahead and tap sleeve to see all that information in more detail this used to be easier to see on the page cuz you could actually tap on the bottom here but they took these menus away in the newest app update so it's just a couple more Taps to get in I guess they're creating friction to see all your data and detail making it easier to just get high Lev scores which I personally am not the biggest fan of I wish I could just have a dashboard of like total sleep you know certain things that I could customize that are most important to me I can see time in bed see Trends over time with time in bed by tapping on that specific number once I get into the contributors if you tap on that you can see why it's a contributor how it contributes how it affects your sleep score and it'll give you insights and feedback hey did you know that you could actually fall asleep too fast like your latency was very low must I must have been very tired last night as well as all my sleep date at once again that is my sleep the second of the big three and the last of the big  three is activity so if I scroll down activity goal I try to wear my ring most of the time during the day but I only wear it all night if I'm working out like weightlifting or grabbing anything where I don't want to have the ring there kind of blocking whatever I'm grabbing I'll take the ring off running I'll sometimes wear it but here it'll show you kind of how many steps I did my walking equivalency my movement throughout the day pretty simple nothing crazy but it can give you a somewhat decent Benchmark on did you get your 10,000 steps for the day which I do like but I don't look into this as detail as possible there is activity tracking which we'll dive into later now there  are two extras which is daytime heart rate and daytime stress when you scroll down you'll see this information daytime heart rate it gives you a graph of all your daytime heart rate you can tap and scroll across it there's a short if time where you seem to be relaxed stress which is the amount of your body felt high stress sleeping which is your heart rate throughout the night and then if you want to see the big three plus these five pieces of information any other way like other dates I can tap on the date at the top and now I can actually scroll through crowns means achievement success you are king queen and I can see my recovery my sleeps data all from that day I think that's so crazy that I can go that far back just to see all of my aura data that's an easy way to jump around the graph to see information you can also swipe left to go through the dates they swipe at the top there so there's two different ways to kind of go into the past for that but there's also  Trends so my health tab if you scroll all the way down there are reports all reports now you can have weekly monthly quarterly yearly and anniversary experiments so let's go anniversary I'm going to do the 5 years 6 months there's going to be a full report on how my sleep steps and overall data right here that's insane I've had this ring for 5 years and 6 months we can do quarterly I can get these cool reports where I can see how much I slept my wake and sleep time my chronotype my daily habits and how they affected my scores whoa 412 hours of inactive time I need to move more huh how many crowns I got for the quarter so all that information is there if we do weekly we get these weekly graphs which used to be in the old app and now they're hidden Within These Trends which can be helpful to understand hey how this week did I do better or worse than last week it's good to just see these insights and if there's certain behaviors you're trying to do more of sleep more walk more these graphs are helpful to be like hey did I do it am I keeping myself accountable or or is it just in my head so that's why I like wearables it can hold you accountable to the goals that you're doing as long as you're measuring in that direction that's the report step  and inside of my health there are a couple more sections that we'll go through so at the top you can see here resilience so this is kind of my stress resilience score you do have to wear your ring I think for 7 days to get this data during the daytime so just make sure you do that has a map of like are you low stress High recovery high stress low recovery and I can scroll back the days to see that changes over the days the trends this is also through the days we can swipe through looks like I was solid and then recently it's been adequate so my resilience has been declining and the factors that contribute to that score guidance and tips maybe I need to get reduced bright lights at night mental rest breathing exercises if I want to open up daytime stress to understand what is stressing me out potentially this can be helpful to help drive that behavior change by understanding that data better that's a new feature that came out and the second one is cardiovascular age which is V2 Max it says hey you're high you're excellent if I looked at it here it says I'm kind of increased or decreased a little bit going strong for 6 weeks I thought it was in the 50 range I need to do more of the actual testing to make sure these numbers are right but it does show a lower number than my Apple watch I just need to do the walking test use a phone GPS on your phone and get that data and then it shows you like how will climbing five flights the stairs feel in 10 years like effortless or manageable I need to change my life to stay within the effortless range you know you want to be able to go up the stairs put your suitcase up there I can see all my data right here these things are imported from Health git to I can add V2 Max data as well if I take a test that's in that Tab and then there's also more weekly guidance and tips so there's a lot of Education pieces inside of the app to help Drive Behavior change the last section is sleep Health we have sleep regularity which for me is good I probably could be better it was fair and I think at one point how's it changed over the years it was good and now it's good so not much doing okay I can see all my activity tags my chronotype is a late morning type I like to wake up around 6:49 a.m. so not an early bird but a late morning and that's the my health section if you tap info you can see all the different information about it I can see my date of birth my weight my height my sex assignment birth the goals and all this information that I can also change within the settings tab  so let's go into the settings tab which is the hamburger on the top left section if you tap that there are a whole bunch of settings that you can change from my ordering seeing your Trends your reports experiments circles the rest mode if you're sick understanding the heart health data turning blood oxygen sensing on and off going into deeper settings or Labs which is new features that are up and coming in beta releases ation with things like Strava natural cycles and other things as well as refer a friend you can give them 10% off I do have links down below if you click that help support the channel and this is where you can monitor all those setting changes so let's go through a couple big important ones my aura ring now if you lose your AA ring you can have your latest location in the app I actually found that the aura ring uses my location way too much whenever I scroll down here it's just like Aura is using your location I'm like why is Aura using my location so personally I actually go ahead and go to apps I don't think Aura has done a good job of tracking in my location just the right amount so I'll come here and I'll say while using app and then I also go into the settings and I'll turn off location tracking but if you do that you will lose this but this is a great way if you lose your ring often to just have the last known location I go to settings location permissions or location features that will also turn off any kind of GPS tracking in outdoor workouts too but it'll burn less of my battery the other way to get to that is also tap the O ring on the top right I can see my battery percentage where I'm at if you want to maintain good battery behavior that information is there and then a share button here where I can actually share images which is kind of cool resting heart rate I can post the Strava if I want with different Aura stickers we'll talk about the STA integration soon now going back to the menu Trends we talked about that you can tap in and see the trends for each section reports I can go into that see the weekly monthly quarterly yearly anniversary and my experiments which we just talked about that and then circles this is kind  of a social thing I have a circle with my health house friends my personal family and a couple other groups and here I can see scores from all my friends you know their sleep activity for either the last day the last map he's not wearing his ring what's going on Omar he's not wear he lost his ring actually oh he lost his membership but it's cool to see everyone's information how often they wear their ring and then you can even see my scores this creates a little bit of a social aspect but it's kind of hard to get to I can give JC a little bit of a hey nice job so it does take some time to get to that I don't use that because it's so deep into the app that it's just not easily accessible I wish the social features were just better Explorer has a bunch of education and things that you can play breathing exercises nice but never use that rest mode if you're sick and you want to turn on rest mode I do this if I'm sick it'll also ask you if it knows that you're sick hey do you want to turn on rest mode so sometimes I don't even need to go in that part of the app heart health which we talked about V2 Max cardiovascular age blood oxygen sensing is a feature that you can turn on and off I keep it on it kills your battery a little bit faster turn it off if your battery dies or a labs this is where you can test new things like the AA adviser which is kind of like an AI gives me recommendations meals I know that they AA actually acquired VAR which is a CGM  company and Dexcom another CGM company invested in them so I think there's going to be a lot of nutrition glucose monitor tracking coming soon to the ordering I'm very excited for that Ora if you want me to test all this stuff out before it comes out please let me know I'm very excited to see how sleep is going to integrate with all of that settings notifications I love to turn off activity bedtime and insight I'll keep inactivity and Battery on I just want to minimize notifications get the basic necessities wom's Health if you're a female you can use Women's Health pregnancy insights getting started just note that this information is on the AA servers so if you are worried about certain privacy aspects just be careful about that but it'll use body temperature and cycle tracking for pregnancy insights I'll talk about natural cycle integration as well so if you go to app Integrations actually I don't have natural cycles but my friend has natural cycles I got her an aura ring so that way you can either plan a pregnancy or prevent a pregnancy this one is set to preventing a pregnancy we can see there are different their cycle count there's a calendar here to see the red days and then the green days which is you don't need to use protection according to to natural cycles app if you want to take ovulation tests you also can there's different trackers inside the graph that you can track as well and then definitions around what each of these things mean your fertility status the period so there's a lot of good education and learning that I've personally learned about females and how the you know ovulation cycle works and period tracking so that's been interesting to learn more about if you want an updated natural cycles video please let me know in the comments below activity you can turn on activity heart rate calorie opt out ways to back up all your data I have the lifetime membership cuz I got the aura range 2 I think and I upgraded and they gave me a lifetime membership and then here I can turn on integration with apple health so I connect the health and all of my ordering data like sleep and all that will get sent to Apple Health app Integrations I have Strava turned on so I can actually publish my workouts to Strava so I just did an outdoor walk and I'll show you it sends it to my sha account it says my step scal achieved the total distance it's using GPS data from my iPhone and then heart rate data from the aura ring so if you are a runner Walker cycler you can use your aura ring for Strava data and not have to buy another watch but you do have to start stop the activities on the ring which I'll show you later let's talk  about starting an activity tracking activity workouts on the bottom right there is a plus sign this is your action button you tap that there's the aura adviser which will give me insights coaching and I can ask it questions it's like a little AI I have unguided sessions where if I want to meditate and just track my heart rate and heart rate variability I can do that add tags if I want to add a certain tag for today so that way I can see Trends over time I wish they would automatically add tags or just make the experience easier you can add an activ activity that happened in the past there are a long list of activities here from dance and all these things you can add the time and it'll create kind of like oh how much did that activity impact your day from a moderate and then it'll say like oh how was the intensity it's not tracking your heart rate live when you do that but it just adds that activity to the app but then there is a record workout heart rate which I think is neat you only get five options running cycling and walking indoor outdoor and the outdoor ones and walking W use your phone's GPS if that is active I just turned it off and then when you scroll down you can see I did walking I'll tap that track with aura you can see my heart rate that was tracked with aura what heart rate zones I was in and also a map actually I did it wrong so I had to walk again because I turned it off but this is the GPS from my phone but then the heart rate data from the aura ring and that's just an easy way to track your workouts if you don't track it it'll actually pop up here and say hey did you hike I can yeah I did I can confirm yesterday's activities like maybe I walked at this time and say confirm and it'll just input that data it tracks your heart rate less often when you do it that way but if you want constant live heart rate data you can track your heart rate data actively by pressing plus starting it and stopping it next one thing I didn't talk about is the Apple Watch app so  there is an Apple Watch app for the AA ring I almost never use this it feels absolutely unnecessary you do have to sync the AA ring to your phone once that is done then you can pull up the aura Ring app on your Apple watch and I can see my three scores I can tap into like sleep and see more detailed data like my total sleep so all that information is accessible on my watch but I don't know how necessary it is considering I have to open up my phone view this data then I have to open up the watch it's like I don't I want it to be directly syncing to my watch which it doesn't do that but hey maybe in the future I don't have to carry my phone I can just sync the order ring to my Apple watch that' be really  nice now when it comes to price the order ring is $3.49 for the base color and it goes up to $4.99 and then there is a $5.99 subscription every month the first month is free after that you got to keep paying it which is not ideal I don't like that you have to pay for the product and a subscription like there needs to be extreme value for you to do that I am in the lifetime so it makes it easier for me but if you are interested I do think the ordering is is one of my favorite Rings please click the link down in the description below if you do plan to buy it help support the channel if you want to see more in this guide for next year let me know or if you want to sponsor next year's guide let me know and we'll see you in the next one peace
