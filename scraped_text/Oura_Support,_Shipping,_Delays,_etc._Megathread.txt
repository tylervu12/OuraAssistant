Post Content:
Support questions, delays, and discussions about shipping regularly overwhelm the subreddit. While it's important to bring attention to these issues, it creates a much harder subreddit to use for most people, so we're creating this megathread to try and contain Oura support discussions, delays, shipping delays, etc.

This will also bring another benefit of any official Oura representatives only having a single place to look for these kind of questions, so they can hopefully help you all quicker and more efficiently.

Icy-Butterscotch8435 (1 upvotes): Hi all,

Just curious how your experiences with customer service have been when getting a ring replaced. I am the owner of two rings, a size 8 gen3 silver and gold. I bought the silver one myself early last year, and was recently gifted the gold for Christmas. I’ve completely factory reset the silver one, and have been using the gold one since then, until recently when it stopped tracking my temperature for about a week.

I reached out to Oura, who said there was no issue with the gold ring and to try some troubleshooting tips, it didn’t work. I started using the silver one again, which started tracking my temperature again, so l messaged them explaining that there must have been an issue with the gold one since the silver one worked perfectly.

They messaged back insinuating it was my fault the gold one wasn’t working because I had 2 rings attached, I messaged back saying the silver was completely factory reset and detached from my account until the gold stopped working, again pushing that there’s an issue with the gold ring.
After some back and forth they agreed that the gold had an issue and needed to be replaced, they asked for some info and if I wanted to swap sizes, I gave it to them and requested a size smaller (7). Shortly after, I get an email saying they’re shipping me a size 8 silver. I email them again saying it’s the incorrect ring and size, they say they’ll fix it and ensure I will be sent a size 7 gold. Well, guess who just got an email for a size 7 SILVER coming to my mailbox? Me.

It’s been a few days of this and I am seriously frustrated how this has become such a hassle, and how customer service seems to be quite disorganized. For the price of the rings, I imaged the customer service experience to go a bit smoother. Has anyone experienced this? Do I just throw in the towel and move on to the next best smart ring competitor?

    Future-Discussion273 (2 upvotes): I have absolutely had it with their customer service. I’ve tried every way possible to get their attention and I get one email every few days. At least you have one working product, I was sent only a ring, no charger, so I can’t even use it. It’s a $300 paperweight, and the last correspondence seems to imply I’m lying about what I received.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Icy-Butterscotch8435 (1 upvotes): they told me if I’d be getting a replacement for the same size ring there would be no charger since the current charger would work, maybe that’s why? They said if I chose to get a smaller size replacement it would come with a charger.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            Future-Discussion273 (1 upvotes): Mine was a brand new order, so it should have come with a charger. Is the ring even worth all this headache?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                Icy-Butterscotch8435 (1 upvotes): Personally I have LOVED my Oura ring, especially because the cycle tracking and meal tracking have really come in handy to share with my dr while dealing with health issues. I wear it daily, and that’s why when the temperature data stopped working I reached out for a resolve. But, the way customer service has handled this has made the ring not worth it in my opinion, there’s competitors out there that do the same thing for the same price or cheaper, with no app subscription fee. This has been my first experience with customer service so I thought maybe it’s a fluke, but reading all the posts under this thread is a little concerning. ☹️

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Future-Discussion273 (1 upvotes): Is there some kind of trick to getting customer support to actually respond? My ring was supposed to arrive Friday, and I opened it to find it was literally just a ring in a plastic baggy inside a padded envelope, no box, charger, start up instructions. The AI robot was quick to tell me this was a mistake, but I can’t get any response from an actual person and quite frankly, I’m pissed and fed up. I considered just starting the return process, but I’m afraid they would accuse me of keeping the kit if I just sent back what I received.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ChickenNuggetsSalad (1 upvotes): After weeks of researching and trying to decide which ring I wanted to get for sleep tracking, I settled on Oura gen 4. I opened my computer and tried to make a purchase on the website several time. It always failed. I tried several different credit cards and other payment methods (Apple pay/Paypal) none of them worked. The site said to talk to the bot, Finn. I did, it didn't help.



After 24 hours I got a reply from support asking me for some information about when I tried to make the purchase. I replied with the requested information. I wanted to use a friend's link to get the savings and pick up at BestBuy. I had requested if they could provide me voucher or something so that I could go to BestBuy and get the savings as they are a partnered vendor. They entirely ignored that request, didn't even acknowledge it.



Another 24 hours goes by and another person replies and tell me there is an issue and they suggest I "keep trying and let them know if it works."



I was told to keep trying to make a purchase. That was their support, no empathy, just keep trying. What a joke.



I would hate to experience their support if I had a malfunctioning product which needed to be replace under warranty. Based on other posts here, they seem to not be supportive at all.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Rich_Astronaut8225 (1 upvotes): Did you get it to work?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        ChickenNuggetsSalad (1 upvotes): They ended up emailing me eventually that they fixed it. I thanked them for their lack of support and helping me decide to go with a competitor

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            Rich_Astronaut8225 (1 upvotes): I have put two tickets in and messaged via Instagram and nothing….. I’m about to go with another company also!

chloe_farrell (1 upvotes): My Oura ring experience. So I was gifted an Oura ring for the holidays and I was excited to have one. Unfortunately it consistently failed to register my HRV as most of the time it was just one dot or maybe a short line in an 7-8 hour sleep on the graph. As the first week went by I tried all the recommended solutions ie cleaning the ring, doing a reset etc but to no avail. So I reached out to customer support and they got back to me right away and had me switch fingers but that didn’t work. So they said they would happily send me another one and once I returned the original one. Everything went smooth and they were very responsive this entire time. Well I got the new ring and experienced the same situation. After a few days I reached out to customer support again and they said they would gladly refund my money as they knew this was the second time I had the same problem. At some point in our email exchange it sounded as if they were suggesting that I try another ring and I was confused so I asked them if they indeed they wanted me to do so. Their response was and I quote:

 

“As for trying another ring, I want to clarify that this isn’t caused by an issue with your current ring but rather an app limitation. Our team is actively working on this, so a new ring would deliver the same results at this time.”

 

Well that is a pretty profound statement. They were admitting that the ring wasn’t functioning the way it was supposed to. In any case they said they would turn it over to their team to assist me in getting the refund. So waited a day or two to hear from someone but never did. So I contacted the original customer support group that I had gotten emails from and said I had not heard anything about returning the ring and getting a refund. No response. Sent another email and still no response. I sent 6 emails and not one response.

 

What a joke! I was ghosted and clearly from the statement made by them they acknowledged there was a app limitation. I am not sure how many other folks have had a problem with their ring or their service. As I stated originally, they were so responsive but then they went dark. Absolutely atrocious and a pretty sad state of affairs for their company.

 

I am absolutely appalled!

No_Move9085 (2 upvotes): - tried to order oura ring 4
- "order not processed, contact customer service/try again"
-tries again with different card
- once again order not processed
-suddenly both credit cards notify me that the charges went through
- now my FSA has been charged twice and my two different credit cards have been charged too
- I have NO order confirmation, order number, or proof. Email/phone number are not coming up as tagged with an order
- can't get ahold of a real person/customer service
- customer service says "we have no timeline, look out for a refund, passed it on to internal services"
- can I even trust this company? I am very disappointed and stressed by this. I was very excited to get an oura ring and now I have 4 total charges I need to worry about getting resolved AND no order or ring to show for it. And if I do get the ring I'm going to need to pay an infinite subscription. Is this a scam??

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No_Move9085 (1 upvotes): They also said they couldn't find any order. Obviously they couldn't find an order with my email because it didn't go through.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New_Amoeba_2344 (1 upvotes): My ring died after 2 weeks and I can’t exchange or get a refund. It seems that we are in the dark concerning customer service, if I knew…

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Queasy-Bullfrog8818 (1 upvotes): I am in the exact same boat! Cannot get anyone from “customer service”  to give me a solution. Just been emailing and opening multiple tickets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Senior_General_683 (2 upvotes): This thread seems useless. No one answers and if you use tag words your post gets deleted. Shameful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PlayWithAshleyStark (2 upvotes): I opened a ticket about my ring on February 9th and have only been told to "take it off" by the AI assistant and three customer service reps. I've given photos and all the information they all asked for (which was literally the SAME questions the previous reps had asked for in the same ticket) and no one has gotten back to me since February 14th despite me asking for updates.

The problem with my ring?

It was heating up and burning my finger. Multiple times at night, I would wake up to my ring being ungodly hot. During the day, I'd have to take it off because the red light would come on for over 15 minutes and burn my finger.

There is no damage to my ring and it's never been submerged by chemicals or water, which the three reps all asked about. No wiring is exposed nor tech. I sent the photos as proof, yet no one helps.

Apparently this is a known problem because if you dig through the reviews online, there are other people that have this problem after a year of having the ring. How unfortunate that Oura is hiding these reviews. The basic warrantee only last a year and somehow after that year is up, the ring starts burning fingers and customer service refuses to help in a timely fashion?

The ring was great before all of this. It tracked my sleep perfectly, predicted my periods to the day, and tracked my steps without fail.

I hate to leave negative reviews anywhere, but I feel like this is very important. If you want actual customer service, you have to have a long warrantee OR be a content creator that promotes Oura. If you don't fall in one of those categories, they don't care about you. Just your money.

  
With shipping, this is over $400 wasted.

Routine_Matter7076 (1 upvotes): Think twice before you buy.
Finger zapping, wrong data reading and now they’re not fully refunding me.

My husband and I planned to get each other Oura rings for Christmas to focus on our health for 2025. How I wish we hadn’t. Been a nightmare with the whole process for 3 months and on going.

Issue 1 - Can’t pay,
Had to contact customer support for payment issues as the shipping address needs to be the same as billing address. How are you suppose to buy Oura as a gift for someone who lives in a different country?

Contacted support and got a response after 1 day. 

Issue 2 - Oura got my order wrong and the tedious exchange process begins.

Due to technical issues with Oura’s site it took the wrong order. 
I ordered 2 rings, 1 size 6 &amp; 1 size 9.
When clicked “submit” I was shown an error message so contacted support.

Support got back to me fairly quickly this time saying my order went through and I should receive a confirmation email.

Somehow it reset both ring sizes to 6 when I clicked “submit”. Ended up ordering 2 size 6 rings.

I’ve contacted support immediately and 7 hours later, they told me my order has been shipped and that had to go through the exchange process.

Waited DHL for the orders to come then realised that need to pay $116 for Import Tax because it’s the price of 2 rings requires import tax.

Which I’d happily pay if Oura didn’t get my order wrong in the first place.

Paid for the Import Tax and waited for DHL again. I also had to call to confirm to check if the import tax payment isn’t a scam.

Got the rings and immediately started the exchange process for my husband’s ring.

Contacted support and got a long instruction(also back and forth messages for DHL pick up information) for exchange and scheduled and waiting for DHL to pick up.


Issues 3 - My ring zaps my finger.

Within 2 weeks of wearing the ring I felt electric shocks when wearing the ring.

Due to the constant zapping I could no longer wear it.

When it occurs:
It first when I was finishing washing my hand and was moving the ring to dry it.

After not wearing it for a full day, I felt the zapping/tingling sensation as soon as I put it on.

The sensation is continuous and frequent enough that I would say it is on going and not under specific circumstance.

I was not handling any kind of battery when the issue occurred.

Sensation:
Dull zapping tingles. If I wear it long enough it feels like it’s pulling a nerve from my finger to my forearm. 

My fingers would feel the dull tingles continuously after taking the ring off for 10mins also.

State of the ring:
No big damage I can see, only a few fine scratches that I would call wear and tear.

Ring has not been exposed to any hard chemicals.

So I decided to return it.

Issue 4 - Inaccurate sleep data reading 

The right size ring finally got delivered(waited for a whole day for DHL delivery) for my husband.

However, he realized his sleep data was inaccurate as he was clearly awake and on his phone when Oura logged him as sleeping.

We decided to return both of our rings.

Contacted support, exchanged a few back and forth messages to confirm address in order for them to process the return shipping - now with UPS, which is a different process. Again, schedule a pickup date, waited at home for pick up.

Issue 5 - Refund.

The refund of ring itself was refunded quickly. However they didn’t refund the shipping cost.

Also customer support said they would also get my import tax refunded, they just need approval from the finance team. It has been a month since I’ve returned my rings and still no refund. 

I’ve followed up with customer support so many times and only got one response saying that the issue has been prioritized to the specialist team. Another week went by still heard nothing.

I’m loosing hope to get my full refund. 

I’ve spent countless HOURS during the whole process and now probably will never have my money fully refunded $116.

ZodiacKatil (1 upvotes): Can I see sleep duration without the subscription ? I am looking to buy a gen 3 ring. I don’t want to get all the fancy data right now, but I want to see if I can get total sleep duration without subscribing. I am searching up on the website and all I could find was AI chatbot answer that I will get 3 scores. Does these scores include total sleep duration ? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

creepingcryptos (1 upvotes): # Resetting one day of data? Possible?

Hello,

I am wondering if anyone might have aby experience with this:

I have Afib currently but we are working on a solution to possibly get it fixed (ablation or cardioversion). Before the purchase of my Oura ring I was not aware that the ring would not record night time heart rate data with an irregular heart beat.

I asked my husband to wear my ring for a night to see if it worked for him and it did. However now my baseline is "his" baseline even though it was only for one night. Is it possible to have one night of data deleted or will my ring normalize to my own body after the heart is fixed? Or would it be better to ask Customer service to do a whole account reset? It seems a shame to lose alll the other data I've collected since 1-15-2025.

The only option I can see is to delete account and data thus rendering me without anything at all.

Any thoughts or knowledge on this would be appreciated.

Thank you

kerpow13 (1 upvotes): I fell asleep with my ring charging and woke up two and a half hours later at 1am put it back on and went back to sleep. Is there any way to correct my sleep data?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AtomicZechariah (1 upvotes): Oura support is completely useless.

  
I tried to buy a gen 4 ring online about a week ago and got a "Your order could not be processed. Please contact customer service here for assistance." error. I tried maybe a dozen times and no dice.

I submitted a ticket, and they got back to me and said that this was a technical problem on their end, they were escalating, and in the meantime I should keep trying and let them know if it went through.

I did this for a few days (on multiple devices and browsers) but nothing worked. I reached back out to Support and they told me it was something wrong with my credit card (I'm trying to buy it using my Amex card because they offer $50 cashback) and to contact my cc company. (I did contact them and they said there are no holds, and they don't even see any declined transactions.)

Then I contacted Support a third time, and they said that my address (I live in an apartment building) had been flagged and there's nothing they can do to help me. (Note: I literally just need to buy it on the website so that I can get my Amex cashback, but I was trying to pick the ring up at Best Buy.)

Try as I might, they just will not let me give them my money. Support has been completely useless. I'm disgusted.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    PlanktonOld5461 (1 upvotes): I experienced the same frustrations using different web browsers, and credit cards. I got the same error message after clicking submit. I chatted with Finn online and sent them emails. Nothing worked. I give up for now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        PlanktonOld5461 (1 upvotes): I finally received an email from Oura with the following message. Then I was able to place an order online using my Amex credit card. If anyone has a problem with ordering online, try another email address.  
  
&lt;&lt; Unfortunately, after reviewing your details, our online system inadvertently placed a restriction on your order attempts. We have now lifted the restrictions that were preventing you from proceeding with the purchase, and going forward, you should be able to place an order using your email address &gt;&gt;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

wutchamafuckit (1 upvotes): Back to back ring failure

I used gen 3 for a year or two, loved it. Recently upgraded to gen 4, loved it more. 

Then after about 1 week of use, it just stopped working. Putting it on the charger and the light would stay lit for 8 seconds then nothing. I googled and tested all of the suggestions, many of which were from here, nothing. So I started a support ticket. 

I decided to relink my gen 3 in the mean time. Ring pairing failed. Over and over. 

It was then I realized now I can’t even use the app! The app is stuck on the “Connect your Oura Ring” Only two options given. “Set up ring” and “no Oura Ring yet?” The later sends me to a website, the former sends me in the Ring pairing failed loop. 

Worst part? I can’t access the part of the app that has my conversation with support regarding the failed gen 4. I force closed the app, didn’t work. I reset phone, didn’t work. I deleted app and reinstalled, same thing. 

Also. I tried purchasing the gen 4 through their website, and it wouldn’t let me. I tried all of my cards. I tried PayPal. I tried on phone and on pc. Support admitted it was a problem on their end so I bought the ring off Amazon. 

Really, really disheartened by this entire experience. L

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    zamoriane (1 upvotes): I've had the 4 for a few months now, and yesterday the exact same thing happened to me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        wutchamafuckit (1 upvotes): I finally found a way to get back to the support menu in the app. It about two days of back and forth with them, but they were helpful and to the point and are sending me a replacement. The replacement will also be under warranty. 

We’ll see if it holds up. 

Also, this sub is stupid for not allowing these posts outside of this thread. If the gen 4 is so faulty enough that too many people are posting here about it, the problem is the ring not the sub.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            zamoriane (1 upvotes): They'll send me a new one.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Old_Construction5098 (1 upvotes): Does anyone know how frequently it tracks my sleep data? For daytime monitoring their website claims it takes measurement for 1min every 5 minutes. So for night is there a gap like daytime or is it continuous?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Worldly_Two_3933 (1 upvotes): I received a ring on 2/15 as a gift in a color I did not want. I have been trying to exchange this ring everyday and keep getting an error message that my order is not recognized. Deal with the support team has been absolutely insufferable- No one gets back to you and there has been zero resolution made. I was going to exchange for another color but with the way this company works, I don’t want to give them my business.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    nishy1 (2 upvotes): Same damn experience

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Worldly_Two_3933 (1 upvotes): It’s horrible. I’m so annoyed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            nishy1 (1 upvotes): Same.  They literally couldn’t give a shit

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                Worldly_Two_3933 (2 upvotes): And when I get a response from them it’s never a resolution. They just keep stringing me along. This is the worst company I have ever dealt with. 

SHEIN has better customer service then this

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

nishy1 (2 upvotes): I don’t know how this company survives. Ordered my wife a ring for Xmas. It came two weeks late. Was the wrong size. Sent it back for an exchange. They received the return three weeks ago. They haven’t dispatched the new one. They won’t return emails and they don’t have record of the exchange being received even though they sent me a confirmation email. 

I means seriously?  It’s mental that they are so bad. 

There is no response from customer service. 

They have elevated to someone who is supposed to reach out but obviously hasn’t. 

There is no phone number. 

They have my money and my ring. 

Fuck them.

Win2002 (1 upvotes): Subject: Ring stopped connecting, phone can't "see" it as a Bluetooth device

I'm hoping someone has a suggestion here. I opened my Oura app the other day, and the app couldn't connect to the ring. Tried a few times. Threw the ring on the charger, fully charged it, still no luck. So I went into my iPhone's Bluetooth dashboard and hit "Forget This Device" on my ring, thinking a re-connect would help. Well, now my phone can't see my ring in its Bluetooth dash at all to pair with it. When I go into the app, it prompts me to put my ring on the charger to connect to it. That doesn't work--the app won't connect to the ring.

So, it looks like my phone simply won't recognize the device anymore. It's fully charged and lighting up. Any ideas what to do? Oura customer assistance is just AI chatbot crap that doesn't help.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    dadbodsquarepants (1 upvotes): If you put it on the charger and then try tapping the charger with the ring on it several times on the table that performs a reset on the ring. Try a few times. It should connect to your phone.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Either-Matter-1424 (1 upvotes): Same here I just made a post

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    carcar01234 (1 upvotes): I’m also having difficulty with the my ring connecting. I just received a replacement ring and it randomly stopped connecting even after trouble shooting and my charger just blinks red. I tried to do all of the resetting options and nothing is working.. so far customer service has not been helpful either.. ugh

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SimilarAd4810 (1 upvotes): I have now received my 3rd gen 4 replacement sent to me. This appears to be a design issue that my ring works great for 3 weeks then randomly stops connecting with the iPhone app. The only thing that I can imagine is that washing dishes or something must be an issue. The ring has charge and the sensor lights activate as normal but zero connection via Bluetooth. Removed the ring in Bluetooth and attempted to add but zero comm. Is this a known issue or just a shitty product?

Da1hen (2 upvotes): Subject: Questions about Oura Ring Stress Tracking and Support Response



Hi Oura Ring users,



I'm posting because I have a few questions about the stress tracking feature and the support response time, and I'd love to hear about your experiences and opinions.



1. Infrequent Stress Measurements



My heart rate is measured almost every hour without issue, but the stress tracking feature barely seems to work. I hear other users are getting measurements every 15 minutes, but in my case, there are significantly more periods without measurements than with. Is this normal? Or could there be a setting or issue I'm missing?



2. Delayed Stress Data Updates



The Oura Ring description states that it provides "real-time insights into your physiological stress." However, in reality, data updates are often significantly delayed. For example, I've seen the 1:00 PM data update at 4:25 PM, or the 6:15 AM data update at 1:30 PM – sometimes more than a 6-hour delay. This doesn't seem to align with "real-time" information. Is this typical behavior?



3. Delayed Support Response



I submitted a support ticket regarding these issues and received a response from the virtual assistant, Finn, stating that a "Member Care Team specialist will investigate this matter further." However, it's been two days, and I haven't received any further contact. The Oura Ring website states that "Our team will typically get back to you within 24 hours," which hasn't been the case. How long does it usually take to receive a response from support?



If anyone has had similar experiences, knows of any solutions, or has information about Oura Ring's support responsiveness, I'd really appreciate your comments.



Thanks!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Manesni (1 upvotes): Yeah I have this exact same issue. No response from support so far.

Silent_Repeat_3676 (1 upvotes): Hello everyone.  I don't post on Reddit very much, but I have had such a negative experience with Oura that I feel I have to articulate it.  I'm glad there are so many people in this community that have had great experiences, but mine has been very poor for a litany of reasons.  I've used Oura for about 9 months and have recently stopped wearing it, and am trying (likely in vain) to return it because of all the issues I've had.  Wondering if anyone in this community has had them as well.  Trying (and probably failing) to be brief:

1) Foremost issue: problems with sleep tracking.  At least once a week, there are large gaps in my heart rate while asleep, which Oura infers as awake time.  The movement chart shows that I'm moving so much that it thinks I'm awake, even though I'm dead asleep.  Sometimes up to 2 hours.  My wife, with whom I've shared a bed for 20 years, can confirm I'm not a fidgety sleeper.  This destroys my sleep score, which then wrecks my readiness score, my activity goal decreases, and my resilience suffers.  There's no way to override Oura for these periods and say that I was asleep during these times.  Worse, I was finding myself developing anxiety over my sleep score -- even having dreams about it -- and worrying about how low it would be.  On nights where I actually \*was\* having trouble sleeping, I'd fixate on how terrible my score would be, which would just keep me up more.  Since removing the ring, I've slept so much better.

2) Record workout HR is very poor.  I work in downtown Montréal and sometimes at lunch I will walk up Mount Royal.  It's an ascent of 550 stairs.  But when I record this workout and check after, sometimes Oura tells me that the lowest heart rate of the entire workout was when I reached the top of the stairs.  Demonstrably false.  How on Earth could this be the measurement it's taken?

3) Workout detection baffles me.  I play hockey once a week, Saturdays from 10:30pm to 11:30pm.  Somehow Oura manages to detect the activity but thinks I \*started\* at 11:30pm.  I raised this issue with customer service who assured me it would eventually learn if I keep correcting it -- it has not.

4) Wear and tear has been terrible, particularly on the palm side of the ring.  After just 9 months of use it is scratched up.  I work a desk job.  I lift weights but use gloves.  I get the feeling that the matte finish is being rubbed off from simple household tasks like washing dishes.

5) Last but certainly not least is the customer service.  I have put through a few support tickets to address some of these issues.  I've been fortunate enough to speak to one very, very helpful individual named Una.  Apart from that, the vast majority of Oura support staff generally respond to concerns with boilerplate, copy-and-paste content, some of which I've now had the pleasure of reading three times.  The worst, however, is my most recent ticket (Oura folks, if you're out there, it's ticket 4420630).  Once I decided that it was time for me to break up with Oura, I opened this ticket asking for -- not demanding -- a refund.  The representative checked my ring's logs and concluded that restless sleep caused the sleep gaps and that a replacement ring would likely yield the same.  This representative then asked me to send information, including images of the receipt (I purchased the ring at Best Buy), which I did.  This was 2 weeks ago, and since then I have heard nothing.  I have asked for any kind of follow up in the chat, and nothing.  Radio silence.

I get it -- it's past the 30 day window for returns and there's nothing that explicitly entitles me to a refund.  But customer service is ghosting me?  Even when I just ask for an update, it's silence?  So insulting.  Just tell me "no" and I can move on with my life, or start the process for the refund.  Absolutely terrible.

tl;dr I am done with Oura because I've had a ton of issues, hoping for a refund but ghosted by customer service.  If you're a restless sleeper -- or if Oura \*thinks\* you're a restless sleeper -- this ring will not work for you.

clairewuthewarlock (1 upvotes): ordered on 31st jan

paid for a very expensive USD 500 piece of scrap metal received on 9 feb.

paid 9% tax duties on it

why? i asked for a gold 11 ring. and the geniuses at oura delivered a stealth (cheaper) size 12 (bigger). with 2 factors to fuck up on, they fucked up on both. truly amazing.

reached out to support (ticket 4469892) got asked to provide some pictures and then nothing further.

i guess my next steps are to dispute with the credit card company because looking at the clownery going on in this thread, doesn't seem like a refund is possible. failing which i will try to get a tax write off for this as a donation to the mentally handicapped, because clearly it is run by people with brain damage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    clairewuthewarlock (1 upvotes): Well folks, the Oura saga continues, and if you thought it couldn't get worse, you'd be sorely mistaken. After my previous post detailing their spectacular failure to deliver the correct product, I finally heard back from Oura support with what seemed like a promising response: *"We'll proceed with arranging the return and replacement of your Oura Ring. Please let us know if there's anything else we can assist you with."*

Ah, the sweet sound of progress... or so I thought. Because after this one-time beacon of hope, they disappeared faster than a startup running out of funding. No follow-up. No next steps. Just pure, unadulterated silence.

Naturally, I followed up with a simple, reasonable request for clarification:

&gt;

And... nothing. Nada. Zilch. My email might as well have been tossed into the void, where lost socks and responsible corporate practices go to die.

At this point, I have to wonder: Is Oura actually a tech company, or is it just a social experiment in testing customer patience? Because for a company that makes *smart* rings, their customer service operates on caveman-tier technology. Maybe they’re chiseling their responses onto stone tablets, and my reply is still in transit via horse-drawn carriage.

Let’s be real—if Oura put as much effort into fixing their customer service as they do into marketing their overpriced jewelry, I wouldn’t be here typing this out like an unhinged man on a mission. But here we are.

So what’s next? Well, seeing as Oura is apparently on a vow of silence, my options are:

1. **Dispute the charge with my credit card company** because clearly, their return process is just an elaborate ghosting ritual.
2. **Start wearing this ill-fitting ring as a symbol of corporate incompetence.** Maybe I’ll engrave “Oura Support” on it as a reminder of this tragic saga.
3. **Use it as a cautionary tale.** If you’re thinking of buying an Oura Ring, just know that getting a response from their support team is harder than winning the lottery.

So yeah, thanks Oura, for adding another layer of anxiety to my life instead of helping me manage it. If I ever get a response, I’ll be sure to let you all know... but I wouldn’t hold my breath.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        clairewuthewarlock (1 upvotes): so many unhappy people getting the wrong ring colour and sizes.

after a season of back and forth, i managed to get the correct ring.

as a sign of apology they gave me 3 months of free subs.

hopefully oura ring customers can get over the hurdle of a potential wrong delivery that takes ages to exchange.

            PlayWithAshleyStark (1 upvotes): Be careful. The ring starts to burn your finger and even when you prove it to them, they will stop talking to you. I have no idea how this company still is in operation.

Infinite_Ad_9070 (1 upvotes): Customer Service Response Time

If you’ve had to contact customer service, on average how long has it taken for them to get back to you?
I had to use the Finn AI feature yesterday to ask about my battery. In the last 2 days I’ve had to charge my ring 3/4 times and when my battery is at 70% it tells me to charge it and the charge icon is in red. The Finn feature told me that they ran a test on my ring and ended up being a faulty battery. I’ve only had my ring for about a month and have never let it get below 25% to charge it, so I know I didn’t mess up the battery. 
It’s been almost 24 hrs since and I’ve not gotten a response😕 
I am charging it again as I’m typing this because overnight it went from 80% charged to 30%.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    PlayWithAshleyStark (1 upvotes): I opened a ticket on the 9th about my ring burning my finger and they replied on the 11th and stopped replying on the 14th. I'm still waiting for them to reply.

Svenixen (1 upvotes): Horrible Customer Service

Is there anyone except AI bots actually working at Oura support? I have been trying to get my membership with Oura 3 to work. It has worked flawlessly for a year but once it hit almost exactly a year of usage it just would just say "payment failed" I have tried changing to three different cards and once it asks for the strong banking authentication (I live in Finland) it just says, error occurred contact support. I use my corporate card in general for this as this is a company benefit (several employees on the same) and it just doesn't accept it for anyone. Private cards just give the error. Both credit or debit. There are definitely funds available, all cards open for global purchases yet it simply does not work. Can't change cards due to the error. It only seems to accept the corporate card when I "update payment". It's been weeks and no response from oura. For a literal multi billion dollar company this is not okay. Does anyone know how to get around the issue or actually get a response from them? The ring is useless without the subscription.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jun3Bug22 (1 upvotes): I was at the house when the Oura ring I ordered through Best Buy was delivered. The shipping box had been opened and re-taped either by the driver or someone at the warehouse. The Oura box had been opened and the ring was stolen along with the bar codes and serial numbers ripped off the side. I contacted Best Buy and they immediately ordered a replacement which I picked up directly from the store. If you are ordering online, I highly recommend having your ring delivered directly to Best Buy or Target or wherever to be picked up from customer service. Warehouse workers and delivery drivers can't be trusted. If I wasn't home at the moment of delivery, I'm worried the store might have blamed porch pirates and not wanted to replace the stolen ring.

Opposite_West5905 (1 upvotes): I just made a long post and it seems to have been deleted?! Doing this as a test.

Long story short, I received a detective oura ring for Christmas, after a run around from Oura and Amazon, I finally got Amazon to work with me to have it replaced (as it is apparently against their policy to replace the item even though it shows as eligible for replacement on their site). When going to purchase, Amazon tells me the item has been banned from shipping since December 20th.

Anyone else able to order on Amazon?

wontonsoup28 (1 upvotes): Is there anyway to speak with someone directly? I have had an extremely unsatisfactory experience regarding your product. After using the sizing guide in store, I ordered a size 10 Oura Ring with pickup at Best Buy. I tried the ring on after picking it up in the car to discover it was too small. I immediately went back into Best Buy so I could exchange it for a different size - they said they were unable to exchanges. They proceeded with a return but provided me with no physical evidence of the return, no email, etc. besides a tiny piece of paper with a customer service PIN on it. There was no dollar amount on the paper and they said that was all they could give me. I don’t know if just the ring was returned or the membership was returned as well. I was not able to get any clarifying information and I do not know if / when my money will be returned. The whole thing felt really scammy.

I had to deactivate my membership a few months ago. My sister sent me a gift card to cover a year of membership. She missed the text that says you can't use gift cards for memberships. Now, she's upset, and I feel ungrateful because I can't use her gift. If you can use a gift card to buy a year of membership as an add-on to a ring, why can't you buy just the year of membership?

a family member got an oura gen 2 from work a couple of years ago and never used it after trying it out. it's been sitting in the box since then. I asked if i could try it out and they gave it to me, and after factory reset it worked great for about 5 days until today it started to loose battery within 5h. i read some threads about this being an issue in gen 3, anyone with experience in gen 2? my app doesnt have any options to turn off features either so I can't slow it down either.

EndofErrors (1 upvotes): If I return my ring for a different color, will my extended warranty and membership transfer to the new one?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Oura_Ring (1 upvotes): Hi, [EndofErrors](https://www.reddit.com/user/EndofErrors/); thanks for the question. I'm not trying to complicate things. However, this will depend on the exchange. You can exchange for a color of the same or less value, in which case the warranty and membership will transfer. Your replacement ring will be covered for the remainder of the original warranty period or for 90 days following the date of your replacement—whichever is longer. See the [Warranty FAQs](https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025439534-Warranty-FAQs) article for more information.  For exchanges to a color of greater value, you would need to refund the original purchase, Including the warranty and membership, as well as the re-purchase of the new ring. We have this [article ](https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500006009441-Return-or-Exchange-an-Oura-Ring)on our exchange policy if you would like more info, or you may contact our [support team ](https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us)directly.   - Paul, Oura Social Care Team.

GrumpyGiant (1 upvotes): Hi, I have had an ongoing issue with account creation for the app.

I submitted my original support ticket sometime in early November, and it got escalated to a higher support level.  But since then I have not heard from the advanced support team despite several inquiries and the issue (an error message every time I enter my email address to create an account in the app) persists.

I have been told the same thing at least 4 times now by the basic support (after having to demonstrate the error for them each time).  The ticket has been escalated and someone will help me soon.

“Soon” is a pretty vague term but in the context of tech support, it is reasonable to expect anywhere from a few hours to a few days.  A few weeks is pushing it.  A few months is absolutely ridiculous.

At this point, I really need to interact with some sort of live support (either text or on the phone) to get this sorted out.  I had even tried to return the ring at one point but it was only offering to refund the ring amount, not the extra I had spent on a one year subscription for the app.  Then the basic tech offered me 6 months of free service so I held off, hoping the issue might finally get resolved.  Alas, I still an stuck with an unusable product and no way to get my money back or reach anyone who can do more than tell me someone else will help me “soon”.

Hey all,
I’ve been having issues with my Gen 4 ring. I’ve reported this and support has basically been ignoring me since December 10. I’ve reached out multiple times but still no response.

nilsej (1 upvotes): Ticket 4318935

Oura seems to be having unfair business practice which feels more of cheating. They have shipped the product instead of cancellation even though it is requested in timely manner to cancel.

Feels like I have requested the cancellation and the customer service have intentionally sped up the label creation so It can not be cancelled. As I got notification of shipping next day and Even right now it shows the item is not shipped just label created.
For no reason I will be responsible for shipping cost.
And I heard that I need to pay for return shipping as well. For no reason I have been put in this situation.
Not an experience I was expecting for such big company

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    GrumpyGiant (2 upvotes): I ordered a ring using Paypal to pay for it (for a cash back reward) and my shipping address was set to an old address for some reason.  I immediately caught it after placing order (which included the sizing kit to be shipped first) and reached out right away to update the shipping.  Even so they were unable to change the shipping address for the sizing kit in time.

Given they had zero incentive to ship my kit to wrong address, I just think the company is a shit show and doesn’t have the systems to handle requests like that with agility.

You can always return it for a refund.

My apologies for the issue and delay in this reply.  If your ring is stuck on the charger, try gently using a flat, non-sharp object (like a credit card) to slide between the ring and the charger from the side. For future charges, align the ring’s small dent with the charger light to help it rest securely. Please feel free to reach out if you need any more help—we’re here for you!

WolfHeartedWarrior (1 upvotes): Hey all! I like many of you, am interested in learning more about my body's rhythms. I have a series of health conditions (including Type 1 diabetes) that make this ring, and especially the Dexcom partnership, a real desire for me. 

Knowing this feature was coming put on the 4th Gen, that's what I bought. "1 in 1,000 falls apart," they said, and man, I really thought it wasn't going to be me... but it is.

My ring is currently in 2 parts and continues to break down. I have had it for less than 1 month and am a 4th grade teacher with no heavy labor to impact my ring. I have been reaching out to Oura via their "AI," Finn (who's about as helpful as a bag of dog poop) for more than a week with no response--not even a "We got your message!" or a "We typically respond within 48-72 hours," or something along those lines. After this post I'm headed to social media to share what's happening to me and how bad this experience has been. As it stands right now I will be giving an honest, 1 star review on every site I can until this issue is resolved... and the lack of information or followup on this makes me concerned that the investment isn't worth it.

How do I get help? How do I reach someone to get support? Is Oura always this slow at responding? How have things been for you all? Is it even worth continuing, or should I return the ring and just get my money back? If this is their normal customer setvice, I'm not sure it's worth it to continue with Oura.

Edited because I'm on mobile and apparently have forgotten how English works. 🤦‍♀️

ExperienceDue6077 (1 upvotes): Experience with Extend

I want to know if anyone else feels as confused about Extend as I am. I purchased my Oura ring December 1st, 2022 with $60 3 year extended warranty.

The last day my ring worked was November 15th, 2024. It went from a battery of 70% to zero in about 10 minutes and after 6 hours of charging, it has not gone up. I’ve tried different cords and different plugs and different outlets. Nothing. It’s a table weight.

I contacted Oura who said that the ring is out of warranty but they would replace it for free, just send them the order. I send them the order, they tell me I’m covered by Extend…

So I file a claim with Extend. They accept it immediately and then say they’ll ship it in two business days on November 25th. 

The week of December 2 rolls around and I haven’t heard a thing. I call every other day until I get a random email from them with a link for a new ring that expires in 30 minutes from the email. 

I click the link and it’s only 4s and I can only get the silvers or blacks, gold and rose gold is $50 extra.

Honestly, I just want my gen 3 gold back :/ I hear issues with the 4. But Extend basically just said FU it’s the option you get, unless you want to email Oura (which I did and they said Extend chooses the options). 

Has anyone had better luck with them? Or Oura customer service? It’s been a month and my membership fee just hit and I’m annoyed.

kc926 (5 upvotes): Has anyone else just been ghosted by Oura customer support? I paid for my first year's membership with my HSA card when purchasing my ring, but almost immediately I noticed my membership said I would be charged after my month long free trial was over (on 11/29). I contacted customer support and went back and forth for a few days, was told a specialist would be reaching out to me. I waited about a week and followed up, but have heard nothing on that thread since (last response 11/5). So I started a new customer support thread, he determined it was a mix-up with my email addresses so I provided the needed information and he said a specialist would be reaching out and again, no specialist even after a follow up email (last response 11/15). Now I've been charged again for the year and am planning to do a charge back with my credit card if I don't hear from Oura soon.

"Your order could not be processed. Please contact customer service here for assistance."

I am a long time owner of an Oura ring and I love this thing so much, but this has been an incredibly frustrating hour of my time, just trying to get my order through. Not sure what else there is to try, and although I have a support ticket submitted, I am worried this won't be resolved during the sale. I have a few people counting on me to order this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ZestyChela (1 upvotes): Did you figure out what it was? Trying to buy one before 12/31 and getting the same message.. I read online trying a different email but that's not it. I suspect it might be my credit card (?).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        TheFriendlySeaCow (1 upvotes): Sorry just saw this, never figured it out sadly. I tried multiple emails and multiple credit cards, I ended up having my sister who lives in another state put in the order for me. Hopefully you were able to order it eventually!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Oura_Ring (1 upvotes): Hi there! I'm truly sorry to hear about the issue you're experiencing when trying to place your order. I completely understand how frustrating this must be! Could you please share your ticket number here or via chat? I'll make sure our team has a look at this as soon as possible, given the time-sensitivity of this matter. Rest assured, we're committed to resolving this for you as quickly as we can. - Jessy, Oura's Social Care Team

escalerawooo (1 upvotes): Hi! If I buy a ring now with the black friday promotion, do I have until Jan 31 to return it if it's fully functional and it has all the accessories? Thank you!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I can confirm that yes, you may return or exchange your fully functional and undamaged Oura Ring for any reason until January 31, 2025, as any purchases made between November 1, 2024 and December 31, 2024 can be returned until then.

kingswaggy1 (1 upvotes): I bought the 1-year subscription at the same time I bought the ring, but when setting up the account, it looks like there is no place to put that information. Does it know? Or is planning on billing me twice for the same thing?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    kc926 (1 upvotes): I'm having a similar issue and am not getting any responses from customer support. I'm sorry I don't have anything to help you with, but trying to bring more visibility to your post.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    kingswaggy1 (1 upvotes): Update, I confirmed that they attempt to bill me in 1 month. But they did charged me with a ring and subscription at the time of purchase

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Greelg (1 upvotes): when i go to the account it doesnt show my sizing kit order, and when i give Finn my order number it gives me an error.  is this normal?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Oura_Ring (1 upvotes): Hi there! Jessy here from Oura's Social Care Team. I'm so sorry to hear you're having trouble getting your order details when accessing your account. I sent you a chat moments ago to request some details, so I can look into this for you, and I will keep an eye out for your reply. Thanks for your patience with this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok_End5793 (1 upvotes): Purchased an Oura ring on monday. Received confirmation of purchase and nothing else. No shipping estimate, no expectations around shipping, nothing. Nor was it on the purchase page.

For a not-so-small sum, I'd expect better communication. Is this the norm? (reached out to customer service but no response). Are they always this bad with communication?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    kingswaggy1 (1 upvotes): Unfortunately that was my experience as well. They send you shipping info a few days later. But if you have specific questions, it is difficult to get a hold of a person. I found reddit to be the most helpful place haha!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Oura_Ring (1 upvotes): Hi u/Ok_End5793, thanks for sharing your feedback. Typically, Oura Rings are delivered 1-2 weeks after you confirm your ring size, but due to low inventory on some models, it can take up to three weeks to ship. You can find more details in our [Shipping FAQs](https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025439494-Shipping-FAQs).

You can also track your order status—including shipping updates—through your My Account [portal](https://ouraring.com/my-account). Once your ring ships, you’ll also receive an email with tracking details.

If you haven’t heard back from support yet, feel free to share your ticket number, and we’ll help escalate it. I hope this helps clarify things! -Jayla

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

y_innnn (1 upvotes): Shipment has been stuck and returned to sender from Amsterdam TWICE now. Ordered my ring Oct 6th and paying membership fee but still don’t have my ring AFTER MORE THAN A MONTH. This might possibly be the worst purchasing experience I’ve ever had. 10/10 would not recommend.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Puzzled_Cat6195 (1 upvotes): My ring stopped working after 2 MONTHS of purchasing it. I had to send a second email through my ticket number to get an answer 5 days later. Then, I emailed back and forth trying factory resets, deleting the app, installing the app as I was told by the employee dealing with my ticket. He messaged me with a list of steps to try for five days until I had to ask about the warranty since the troubleshooting was clearly going nowhere. Again, the ring only worked for two months.

I then received an email from another employee sending me another list of steps to troubleshoot. I took screenshots of everything to prove I was actually following the troubleshooting. Almost 10 days after my initial ticket, they said they were sending me a new ring and they provided an order number. 

It’s been two weeks since I got the order number and have received no confirmation of shipping and it doesn’t show up in my account. I tried asking the virtual assistant Finn an update with the order number and he says there’s something wrong and had me put in a new ticket request.

This is incredibly frustrating. I actually loved using the product and was not expecting for it to stop working after 2 months. At this point, I don’t even know what to do. I am so disappointed with the customer service.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MrMelleJ (1 upvotes): While initially being very happy with Oura, with both the fitting kit and the ring itself being shipped very fast, UPS has misplaced my ring during shipping, also not knowing where it went and them telling me to contact the seller of the product so they can do a claim, I'm sadly getting no reply on my ticket just like a lot of people. Guess this is another case of company have great hardware but doesn't have their CS scaled up properly.

EDIT: As is with all the things, it suddenly did move forward, so let's keep our fingers crossed it keeps doing so :)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

pm_toss (1 upvotes): I have the new gen 4. I have been trying for over a week to get a receipt to get reimbursed with FSA. Should I just return the ring at this point?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Oura_Ring (1 upvotes): Hi u/pm_toss, thanks for reaching out here about the invoice. I know how important it is to get that sorted quickly for your FSA reimbursement, and I’m sorry for the wait!

If you could share your support ticket number or chat us your order number , we’ll prioritize this and make sure you receive your order invoice promptly. No need to worry about returning the ring—we’ll get this taken care of for you.

Thank you for your patience, and please let me know if there’s anything more I can assist with. -Jayla

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ok_End5793 (2 upvotes): You should be including estimating shipping times on both the purchase page and in the purchase confirmation. That I made a purchase and have never been given a timeline or had any expectations set is very messy customer service.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        thekatestewart1 (1 upvotes): It’s the absolute worst. The estimated shipping times they provide aren’t even close or reasonable. My ring took over the 1-2 weeks, hadn’t even processed or been shipped out so I changed the address because I am home for a month at the holidays. They are now telling me to wait three weeks before they will escalate it. At this rate, I will have paid for my ring two months ago but yet no ring. It’s ridiculous.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cryingtho (1 upvotes): Hey all, I was wondering, if I buy my Oura ring through Amazon, can I still use Oura support when needed? Or will they only assist you if you buy directly from them? Thanks!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Oura_Ring (2 upvotes): Hi u/cryingtho! Yes, if you purchase your Oura Ring through Amazon, you'll still have access to support from our Member Care Team ([here](https://support.ouraring.com/hc/)) whenever you need it. Just be sure to keep your order information handy, as our team may need it for any warranty requests.

Let us know if there’s anything else we can help with, and happy tracking! -Jayla

Caddiemollet (1 upvotes): The inside of my ring spontaneously cracked and broke off while I was in the shower. I submitted a support request with photos over 7 days ago and haven't received a response. My ring is pretty uncomfortable to wear right now because the broken plastic bit rubbing my skin raw, but I really want to stay updated on my stats as I'm in my early first trimester ever :( Anyone know when I can expect a response??

    Oura_Ring (1 upvotes): Hi u/Caddiemollet, I’m so sorry to hear about this. I’ve sent a chat to gather more details from you, so we can get this resolved quickly.

meerkatdestroyer12 (1 upvotes): Is anyone's Oura ring stuck as, "On the Way / Arrived at Facility / Koeln, Germany"?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Few-Lobster-5865 (1 upvotes): Mine took a day in Koeln to get clearance from customs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        meerkatdestroyer12 (1 upvotes): How does your shipping timeline look? Mine updated to Departed from Facility / Koeln. Not sure if this means it’s on the flight to NA now or if it’ll go to another European airport

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            Few-Lobster-5865 (1 upvotes): Well, actually I discussed a bit about my experience just a few messages below in this very sub. I received my ring yesterday, but I am in northern France, so pretty close to Koeln, which is the big UPS hub in Europe. 

Yes, if it is indicated as "departed from Koeln", I would expect that it is indeed on a flight, from what I have seen there is another big UPS hub in Tenessee I think, so that is probably the next step.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flux-Capacitor-1955 (1 upvotes): Pre-ordered on 10/3, sizing kit received on 10/11, confirmed ring size on 10/11. Status has been “Pending Fulfillment” ever since. Support tickets have gone unanswered. I’m in California. Pretty frustrated because the Oura Ring 4 can now be ordered direct from Oura for pickup at a local Best Buy without shipping fees. I paid $15 for shipping and it hasn’t shipped yet.

I’m close to calling my credit card company to get my money back. I have not been able to get any help from Oura support.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Oura_Ring (1 upvotes): Hi u/Flux-Capacitor-1955, I apologize for the delayed shipping and response times. Our Community [Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/ouraring/comments/1gfd827/oura_community_update_shipping_support_times_how/) covers some recent challenges and explains our current fulfillment timelines, which might provide a bit more context.

If you’d prefer not to wait any longer, you do have the option to cancel your pre-order for a full refund before it ships. If that’s something you’d like to pursue, or if you’d like us to check on your order status, please share your support ticket number here, and we'll look into it as soon as possible.

Thanks for your patience, and I’m here to help however I can. -Jayla

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Flux-Capacitor-1955 (1 upvotes): Hi u/Oura_Ring Jayla, thank you so much for responding. I appreciate your Master Update to the Oura Community. I understand the logistical challenges Oura is facing due to the new Oura Ring 4 product launch.

With respect, I waited the full 2 weeks after confirming my ring size before submitting a support ticket through Finn about this issue. As capable as Finn might be, for some reason or another, it is unable to provide me with updates on my order or the ability to cancel my order. Because of that, frustrated customers like me have reached out to any possible support channel (multiple tickets, social media, etc.) to get anybody to respond.

My support ticket: 4156883

Can you please provide me a definitive status update on my pre-order and, if it has not shipped, cancel it for a full refund? I will get the product faster by placing another order through Oura for free pickup at a local Best Buy.

Thank you kindly for your help!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            Oura_Ring (0 upvotes): Thank you for your understanding and patience—I really appreciate your feedback on using Finn. Due to technical limitations, Finn can view order status but not the specific reasons for delays. I’ll be sharing this with our chatbot team so we can work on improving Finn’s responses to be more helpful for questions like yours.

I’ve located your support ticket and will check the current status of your order. If it hasn’t shipped yet, I’ll proceed with the cancellation for a full refund so you can pick one up locally at Best Buy. If that's the case, I’ll follow up via your support ticket with a confirmation.

Thank you again for your patience, and please feel free to reach out with any other questions or feedback! -Jayla

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                Flux-Capacitor-1955 (1 upvotes): Thank you so much, Jayla! I appreciate your help. I look forward to hearing from you soon through the support ticket.

Few-Lobster-5865 (1 upvotes): Confirmed my size on 10/25 in the morning, I got the "shipped" email on the 10/25 in the evening.

However, until this morning (10/29), the UPS website indicated they did not have my parcel. Then suddenly, last night it went apparently from Netherlands to Germany, then to France. However, at the moment I don't actually know where it is! UPS says that the parcel is delayed and that they are "preparing it for clearance", but the location for this specific step is back to Germany... So I don't know, it looks like it was denied entrance and returned back...

Did that happen to someone else?

I hope the customs did not make a mess of my parcel...

Despite that shipping problem, in my case they definitely are within the indicated timing. Although I suspect my location (France, pretty close from their shipping warehouse) and my size (12, pretty big and maybe not too high demand) may have helped.

  
EDIT: For the record, my parcel was retained for a day in Germany (Koeln), it was released in the night (10/30) and I received it today. So six days total, with a weekend in between, from the "shipped" email to the delivery.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    meerkatdestroyer12 (1 upvotes): Mine had "preparing for clearance" in the Netherlands for a day and now its in Cologne Germany and I'm hoping it'll actually get on a plane to Canada but I've heard of lots of delays for the UPS terminal there...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Decent_Town_861 (1 upvotes): I confirmed my size on 10/21 and it's still pending fulfillment. (Silver size 9, US). What is the current time for shipping? When should I start getting concerned?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    jerseygrl__ (1 upvotes): I ordered gold size 9 on 10/19 and I got the shipping email late Friday night. But, my package hasn’t moved since then. It appears it’s just hanging out in Kentucky. The DHL website says it’s supposed to arrive tomorrow. I’m not holding my breath though.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Real_Custard4608 (1 upvotes): Ring was preordered on Oct 3 and i still havent received anything. Only "your order is being processed" on Oct 8.
Anyone else still not received their preorder?

Im in Sweden, silver size 14

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    PhilosopherGoose (2 upvotes): I’m also in Sweden. I ordered mine on 25/10 and got a shipping confirmation today, 30/10. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Real_Custard4608 (1 upvotes): Funny enough I got my shipping confirmation about 1 hour after posting that. UPS says its arriving today, last update was Malmö 4:30 this morning. Hopefully you will get yours tomorrow:)

bondi_pe (1 upvotes): I just got my first Oura ring, gen4, two weeks ago, and I just cannot get Daily Tags to repeat themselves. This worked when I had "Rest mode" activated, but not without it... The tags appear for the day I tag them, but not for the consecutive days, so it seems like the toggle does nothing at all.

Am I doing something wrong, or does it not work the way I expect?

nova_7674 (1 upvotes): My 8 months old oura 3 stopped working, they sent the wrong size replacement and now they say I cant get the original size because there’s a limit to one exchange per ring..  is this a joke?

Dense-Objective6596 (1 upvotes): **Customer support when buying from 3rd party sellers??**

Hello - I found a great deal on eBay for a gen 4. Highly reviewed/rated seller and I have 60 days for returns if something does not work.

Would Oura customer support still help me if I happen to face any issues with my ring like battery damage or either hardware or software if I did not buy their ring directly from them? 

Anybody with experience on this?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

flashpunk (1 upvotes): I received my oura ring 4, i pre-paid for a year membership. But when I activated the ring the membership didn't apply to my account, so I dont have any of the features that the ring offers. I've been waiting for 9 days now for a response from their support. I'm pretty much ready to return the ring.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    meerkatdestroyer12 (1 upvotes): That’s concerning. I’m still waiting for mine to ship and I prepaid for a year too…

MoreBeignetsPlease (1 upvotes): Anyone had to get their Gen3 replaced recently? How long is it taking to ship those out? I've had a terrible experience with customer support so far - 2 weeks before they even looked at my ticket and another week to say they'd replace it and a lot of other aggravations. Will they ship it before I send the broken one back? If I won't get the replacement in 2 weeks or less, I need to look at other options.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    nova_7674 (2 upvotes): Just went through it and they lost me as a customer. They sent me the wrong size replacement (took 10-12 days after initial ticket) so I reached out again asking to send me my initial size and added a comment that say « why would you even send a different size without a charger? » . They then responded with « oh you need a charger, there you go ! Reached out AGAIN to say i dont want a charger, i need to return both rings and get my size. I just got the response and i had to sit down.. they said «  We understand that you would like to return the size replacement that was sent to you. First and foremost, we would like to inform you that we can only process once in warranty, and since you originally requested for the size 6 replacement, it can not be processed again for commercial returns for a return. »

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        MoreBeignetsPlease (1 upvotes): WOW! That is seriously messed up. They really don't pay any attention to messages, their responses to me have been wrong a couple of times. I'm already on the fence with them, if they screw this up, which I expect them to, I'll bail. I've been reading that their closest competitors have fulfillment/support problems, too but I'd rather try with someone new. Treating existing customers so badly is a bridge-burner.
