You can pay for your ongoing Oura Membership with a credit card or Paypal and follow the indirect reimbursement process. Invoices for recurring membership payments can be downloaded from the Membership Hub and sent to your provider. Oura’s 2-year and 3-year extended warranties are not HSA- or FSA-eligible expenses. Making a Purchase How do I submit purchases for indirect reimbursement?

Also see Oura Ring 4 . If you're setting up your Oura Ring 4 as a new or current member, see the instructions in Set Up an Oura Ring . Upgrading to Oura Ring 4 While we don't have a discount or trade-in program in place for current Oura members, many of the new features we announced today are also available on previous generations of Oura Ring. We hope you enjoy the new app and new features, and when you're ready for a new ring, Oura Ring 4 is waiting for you. If you do want Oura Ring 4 now, we recommend selecting a sizing kit as part of your purchase, even if you recently purchased your Oura Ring Gen3. This will help ensure the ideal fit. Upgrade Discounts for Current Members While we don't currently offer a trade-in program, current members can use their Refer a Friend discount for themselves. To find your referral code: Open the menu from the upper left corner of your home screen Tap "Refer a Friend"> Select "Share your link" Send the link to yourself via text or email Click on the link to go to the Oura online store—your 10% discount will be automatically applied Choose your preferred Oura Ring 4 style Exchanging Oura Ring Gen3 for Oura Ring 4 If you have recently made a Oura Ring purchase, see below for exchange options.

After canceling, you can place a new order for Oura Ring 4 from the Oura online store or various retailers . I've already received my Oura Ring If you’ve purchased your Oura Ring from the Oura online store recently and it has shipped, you can start your return here If you live outside of the US, Canada, Finland, Germany, or the UK, contact us to start the return process. Otherwise, use our self-service portal here If you purchased your Oura Ring from one of our retail partners , you are subject to their return and exchange policy. Please contact the retailer for more information. You cannot return or exchange a ring from a retail partner through Oura directly Direct exchanges at different prices are not possible, and you can't pay the cost difference to upgrade The sizing for Oura Ring 4 is slightly different from Oura Ring Gen3. If you're switching between these different ring generations or uncertain about your size, make sure to use the right Oura Ring Sizing Kit for an accurate fit. The Oura Ring 4 Sizing Kit includes white ring sizers, and the Oura Ring Gen3 Sizing Kit includes black ring sizers. Can I transfer my Oura Membership from Gen3 to Oura Ring 4? Regardless of the type of membership you have, your Oura Membership will continue to work seamlessly with Oura Ring 4. Since your membership is tied to your Oura account (not the ring itself), all of your data and benefits will carry over. Once you pair your new Oura Ring 4 , you'll see all your data in the Oura App. Lifetime Membership Availability There is no Lifetime Membership available to anyone purchasing or upgrading to Oura Ring 4. If you are an existing lifetime member, your membership is associated with your account and not your ring. Therefore, your current membership and all its benefits will carry over to your new Oura Ring 4 once you've paired it with your Oura App. Gen2 Users If you currently own an Oura Ring Gen2 and you purchase a new Oura Ring 4, you will be prompted to select a membership option when you pair your new ring. There are monthly and prepaid annual membership options available. There are no Lifetime Membership offers available. If you prefer to use your Oura App without a membership, we suggest continue using your Oura Ring Gen2. Gifting Your Oura Ring Once you receive your new Oura Ring 4, we encourage you to share the gift of health by passing your current Oura Ring to a friend or family member. Oura Ring 4 Separation Issues A small number of members have experienced their Oura Ring 4 side or outer cover separating.

Oura Ring 4 Battery Life – Oura Help Why Oura How It Works For Business Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Accessibility Why Oura How It Works For Business My Requests Shop Oura Help Troubleshooting Ring & Charger Articles in this section Oura Ring 4 Battery Life Ring Battery Tips Enabling the Oura Ring Gen3 Bluetooth Security Update Troubleshooting Charging Issues Caring for Your Oura Ring Factory Reset an Oura Ring Lost Ring Power Saving Mode Product Safety & Use Known Issues Oura Ring 4 Battery Life Relative to other health wearables on the market, Oura Ring has a long battery life and quick charging time—two of the many reasons members love Oura Ring. You might be wondering how Oura Ring is able to achieve this battery feat, and how we calculate expected battery life. To calculate expected battery life, we conducted extensive testing using new, unworn Oura Ring 4 rings. We assumed Oura Ring 4 was worn all day, Automatic Activity Detection with Activity Heart Rate capture was engaged for one hour per day, Blood Oxygen Sensing (SpO2) was disabled, and eight hours of sleep were tracked per night. We tested using sizes 8-10, which make up the majority of members' ring sizes. The ring was fully charged at the start, and we drained it to 0%. Based on this, Oura Ring 4 achieved a battery life of 7-8 days. What can cause variations? Ring size: Larger rings have slightly larger batteries, while smaller rings have slightly smaller batteries Blood Oxygen Sensing: Many members choose to turn off Blood Oxygen Sensing if they see that after several nights of data, they’re receiving an Optimal or Good breathing rating or oxygen saturation levels of 95% or higher. For those who leave Blood Oxygen Sensing on, battery life may be up to two days shorter, depending on sleep duration Automatic Activity Detection with Activity Heart Rate: Battery life may be up to one day longer for members who use this feature for less than one hour every day. For those who use it more frequently (e.g., 2-3 hours per day), it may be up to two days shorter. Ultimately, actual battery life will vary based on the factors above and other factors, including ring age, total usage to date, and other features. Remember, depending on battery level, it takes only 20-80 minutes to charge your Oura Ring 4, so feel free to drop it onto the charger for short bursts more frequently (e.g., when you take a shower each day). Not only will this not damage the battery, but Oura’s lithium polymer batteries actually perform the best when they’re at 25-80%. See more tips on how to ensure the best possible battery life here. Our testing was conducted in a controlled environment before Oura Ring 4 was available for purchase. Now that Oura Ring 4 is commercially available, we are actively monitoring real-world battery life. Based on early usage of Oura Ring 4, these controlled environment estimates remain accurate.

Shipping FAQs – Oura Help Why Oura How It Works For Business Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Accessibility Why Oura How It Works For Business My Requests Shop Oura Help Orders & Shipping Purchases & Shipping Articles in this section Shipping FAQs Purchase an Oura Ring How to Gift an Oura Ring Oura Gift Cards Expedited Shipping Purchase with HSA or FSA Funds Finance Your Purchase with Affirm Retail Locations Manage Your Orders Shipping FAQs This article contains answers to frequently asked questions related to shipping.

Countries Oura ships to: North America Europe Africa & Middle East Asia-Pacific What’s the average shipping timeline? If you are purchasing an Oura Ring for the first time, we recommend selecting the free sizing kit from the Oura online store . Oura Ring sizes are slightly different than standard US ring sizes, and going through our sizing kit process ensures you'll find your best possible fit, which will deliver the most accurate data and insights from your ring. Sizing kits are delivered 3-9 business days after you receive an order confirmation from us. Sizing kit orders in the EU can take 1-2 weeks for delivery. If you received a sizing kit from a friend or family member and have already determined your Oura Ring size, you can select your size directly from the dropdown menu on the Oura online store . Your Oura Ring will be delivered 1-2 weeks from when you confirm your ring size. Due to low inventory on some Oura Ring models, we will ship orders based on the priority in which they are received. Some orders may take up to three weeks to begin shipping. You can also check availability at our retail partners— Amazon , Best Buy , or Target —to see if the desired ring model is in stock there. You can keep up-to-date on the status of your order (e.g., ring size confirmed, ring shipped, ring delivered) through your My Account portal, located in the footer of ouraring.com .

Does Oura offer expedited shipping? Expedited shipping is currently available for US only. When available, expedited shipping costs $35 , and can be selected in the "Shipping" section of the checkout process. Orders cannot be expedited to a PO Box address. This will delay the shipping of the order and require an address change. Expedited Shipping Timeline Expedited shipping is only available for the first shipment in your order. For example: If you choose our sizing kit option, the kit will be sent by expedited shipping, and your Oura Ring will be sent by standard shipping. For purchases without a sizing kit: your Oura Ring will be delivered within 1-3 business days. For purchases including a sizing kit: the sizing kit will be delivered within 1-3 business days, and your Oura Ring will arrive within 2-5 business days after you confirm your ring size . Can I update my delivery address? For orders that have not already shipped: You can contact our Member Care Team here . Note: If you need to update the delivery address for your Oura Ring, you'll need to contact our team prior to confirming your ring size.

Ring Battery Tips – Oura Help Why Oura How It Works For Business Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Accessibility Why Oura How It Works For Business My Requests Shop Oura Help Troubleshooting Ring & Charger Articles in this section Oura Ring 4 Battery Life Ring Battery Tips Enabling the Oura Ring Gen3 Bluetooth Security Update Troubleshooting Charging Issues Caring for Your Oura Ring Factory Reset an Oura Ring Lost Ring Power Saving Mode Product Safety & Use Known Issues Ring Battery Tips Follow these tips to get the most out of your ring's battery life. Read more about Oura Ring 4 Battery Life. Update Your Ring's Firmware Charge Your Ring Before Going to Bed Enable Airplane Mode Enable Low Battery Notifications Prevent Damage to Your Battery Properly Store Your Ring Only Use Your Ring with One Device More Information Oura Ring 4: A fully charged ring may last up to eight days. Oura Ring Generation 3: A fully charged ring may last up to seven days. Battery life and longevity depend on Oura Ring size, Oura App settings, feature configuration, activity, battery age, usage, and many other factors; actual results will vary. Battery life and charge cycles vary by use and settings. Battery tests were conducted across various sizes and scenarios. See Ring Battery tips for more information. Oura Ring 4 battery estimates are based on consumption data of internal users, analyzing usage from 100% to 0% battery levels. Oura Ring Generation 3 battery estimates were used as a reference to validate any improvements. Your Oura Ring can take 20-80 minutes to fully charge , depending on its current battery level. You can check the battery level by tapping the battery icon in the upper-right corner of the home screen. Update Your Ring's Firmware To ensure the latest firmware version is available, first update the Oura App to the newest version available in the app store on your device. Starting with version 2.9.11, Gen3 firmware will update automatically . Note: for the firmware update to succeed, your phone’s Bluetooth must be enabled and your ring’s battery level must be above 30%. Oura Ring 4 Firmware Versions Generation 3 Firmware Versions Generation 2 Firmware Versions Once you've updated your ring's firmware, go through two charge cycles with your ring. A charge cycle is when you charge the ring to 100% and then allow the battery to deplete to about 25%. After each charge cycle, back up your ring data by doing the following: 1. Place your Oura Ring on the charger for a few minutes 2. Open the Oura App and wait for the latest sync. If the sync doesn't happen, you can still proceed with the backup 3. Tap the menu in the upper-left corner of the home screen 4. Tap Settings 5. Under Account, tap Back up all data Charge Your Ring Before Going to Bed We recommend charging your ring to at least 30% before going to bed. If your ring's battery level is low, you may not receive sleep insights for the night. You’ll still receive a bedtime and wake-up time, but no Sleep or Readiness Score, and no further breakdown of your sleep stages, heart rate variability, respiratory rate, or resting heart rate. Having your charger on-hand (such as in your purse, car, backpack, or at your desk) can help you get into a routine of charging your ring for a little bit each day. Consider charging your ring during natural periods of low activity, such as when washing dishes, typing on your computer, showering, cooking, etc. Enable Airplane Mode If you’re looking to get the most out of each charge, we suggest placing your ring in Airplane Mode . This turns off all Bluetooth communication between your ring and phone, which can help to conserve battery. Enable Low Battery Notifications To receive reminders before bed when your Oura Ring battery is low, enable battery level notifications in the Oura App. Go to the menu in the upper left-hand corner of the home screen Tap Settings > Notifications Enable battery level notifications Note: notifications will not appear if your ring is in Airplane Mode. Prevent Damage to Your Battery The USB charging power cord is intended to be supplied by an external 5Vdc supply that complies with EN 62368-1 standard. Other factors may also lead to battery damage: Leaving your ring on the charger for a period of time greater than one week. Charging for extended periods of time while at maximum capacity can negatively affect battery life Long exposure to extreme temperatures (-20–60 ºC / -4–140 ºF) Properly Store Your Ring If you plan on taking a break from wearing your ring (for more than two weeks), we recommend charging your ring above 50% and then placing your ring in Power Saving Mode before storing it. Only Use Your Ring with One Device The intended use and setup of an Oura Ring should consist of the following: one ring, one account, one device. If there are multiple users or data sources feeding into the same account, this leads to missing data, connectivity issues, or even accelerated battery consumption.

If you purchase an additional ring with an existing Oura account, you will not receive another complimentary month of Oura Membership. If you would like to change the currency for your Oura Membership payments (e.g., from USD to CAD), you will need to cancel your membership and renew it on your next billing date in Membership Hub . You will continue to have the full Oura App experience through the end of your current billing cycle, and all of your data will be in your app once you renew. How do I activate my Oura Membership? When setting up your ring, you will be guided through the membership sign-up process. You will create an Oura account using your email address, select either a monthly or annual ongoing plan, and add your preferred payment method. New members receive one complimentary month of membership, which begins as soon as your ring is paired with the Oura App and lasts for 30 days. This complimentary month cannot be paused or restarted once it begins, and your payment method won’t be charged until the month is over. After that point, your account will be auto-billed every month for a monthly or annually, depending on your plan. You can change or cancel your membership plan at any time. The email address that you use to set up your Oura account can be different from the one used to purchase your ring. If your ring was ordered with a prepaid membership, the prepaid period will automatically be applied to the first Oura account created during setup. Once applied, a prepaid membership can't be transferred to another account. To check the email address connected to your Oura Membership, go to the menu in the upper-left corner of the Oura App's home screen. Select Settings, and you'll find your email listed under Account. Add-ons, such as a prepaid membership, can only be applied to an active Oura account with a payment method set up. Don’t worry—your payment method won’t be charged until your prepaid period ends. This includes the first complimentary month, followed by 12 months of prepaid membership. All features of the Oura App are available during the complimentary period except for Body Clock, Chronotypes , and monthly, yearly, or Oura anniversary reports . These features require more than 30 days of Oura data, and so will not appear in the app until after the complimentary month of membership. What payment methods are accepted for Oura Membership? You can pay using PayPal or a Visa, Mastercard, or American Express credit card. Financing options, such as Affirm, are not available for Oura Membership fees. Currently you can’t add an HSA or FSA cart as a payment method. Where can I manage or cancel my Oura Membership? You can manage your Oura Membership through the Oura App: Select the menu in the upper-left corner of the app's home screen Select "Settings" Scroll to "Account" Select "Manage membership" You can also manage your Oura Membership by directly visiting Membership Hub . In the Membership Hub, you can: Billing information: See your membership status, current plan, and next payment date Payment details: Switch from monthly to annual plans, view and edit your payment details and billing address, and view and download past billing cycles and invoices Account information: Update the email or password associated with your membership Cancel your membership: If you cancel your Oura Membership before your complimentary month of membership ends, then you will not be charged. You'll retain access to the features until the end of your billing period Changes to membership plans take effect at the end of your current billing cycle. If you purchase a monthly plan and switch to an annual plan, then annual billing takes effect when your current month of membership ends If you purchase an annual plan and switch to a monthly plan, then monthly billing takes effect after the remainder of your annual plan If you purchase a monthly or annual plan and then cancel your membership, you will retain access to Oura Membership for the remainder of your plan Partial refunds aren't available for canceled prepaid or annual membership plans after your complimentary month of membership ends Can I transfer my Oura Membership to a new ring? Since your Oura Membership is linked to your Oura account, if you upgrade or replace your ring, your membership will automatically transfer as soon as you pair the new ring with your Oura App. Regardless of the type of membership you have, your Oura Membership will continue to work seamlessly with a new ring. How do I renew my Oura Membership? If you have a payment method on file, it will be charged automatically at the start of each billing cycle, and your membership will continue—there's no need to manually renew. If you want to renew a canceled Oura Membership, you can do so after the end of your complimentary month or current billing cycle. There is no option to "pause" an Oura Membership. Can I use my Oura Ring without an Oura Membership? Oura Membership unlocks the full potential of the Oura App, allowing you to access detailed insights and personalized guidance. Without a membership, the Oura Ring can be used only with limited functionality. You’ll be able to see your three daily Oura scores, ring battery, basic profile information, app settings, and the Explore content. Without membership, you cannot access the Oura API, but you can still download all of your personal data through Oura on the Web . Gen2 users do not require an Oura Membership and will not be charged membership fees. We’ll continue to support the Gen2 ring with routine software and firmware updates for the foreseeable future. However, due to hardware differences, many new features introduced in Gen3 and Oura Ring 4 are not compatible with Gen2. If you’re a Gen2 user interested in upgrading to a Gen3 or Oura Ring 4, keep in mind that you’ll need to sign up for a monthly or annual Oura Membership. With Oura Membership, you’ll unlock access to advanced insights, enhanced tracking, and a range of new features designed to give you a deeper understanding of your health and wellness. Will I lose my Oura data if I cancel my Membership? No. If you cancel your membership, and do not delete your account , all of your Oura data and account information will remain securely saved under our privacy policy . Once you re-enroll in Oura Membership, your data and account information will immediately be accessible again. Even without a membership, you can view your three daily scores within Oura on the Web , and can export all of your Oura data in CSV or JSON formats from there. Can I gift an Oura Membership? You can include a prepaid annual Oura Membership plan with any new Oura Ring purchase from the Oura online store . If you gift an Oura Ring with a prepaid membership plan, the giftee will still receive a complimentary month of Oura Membership. When the giftee pairs their Oura Ring to the Oura App , they will be asked to provide payment details to enroll in Oura Membership. However, the giftee won't be billed until after the prepaid period. What is a Lifetime Membership? There currently is no option to purchase or upgrade to a Lifetime Membership. Some Gen3 members have a Lifetime Membership due to a limited-time promotion offered in previous years. If you have a Lifetime Membership, your Oura Membership remains free as long as you keep the same active Oura account. You can check your membership plan by going to Settings > Account > Manage Membership. Lifetime Memberships cannot be gifted, transferred, or sold to another member. Since your membership is tied to your Oura account, all benefits will seamlessly transfer to any new or replacement ring, including upgrades to Oura Ring 4, once you pair it with the Oura App. More information Oura Ring 4 Oura Ring Generation 3 Previous Oura Ring Generations How to Gift an Oura Ring Oura on the Web Change Password or Email Address Was this article helpful? 2474 out of 5600 found this helpful Return to top Related articles Oura Ring Generation 3 Oura on the Web Ring Battery Tips Troubleshooting Connection Issues Set Up an Oura Ring Social Our Company About Us Leadership Medical Advisory Board Careers Press The Pulse Blog Support My Account Sizing Oura on the Web Extra Charger Oura Memberships Contact © 2024 Oura Health Oy.

For specifics, follow the instructions below. Keep in mind: if you've enabled low power mode or power saving mode on your device, apps running in the background may not receive updates or send you notifications. Enable Notifications in Oura Enable Notifications on Your Device Notification Specifics Battery Level Inactivity Alerts Activity Progress Bedtime Notifications Troubleshooting Notifications Enable Notifications in the Oura App Tap Settings > Notifications From here, you have the ability to toggle on or off the five notifications sent from your Oura App. These include low battery level reminders, inactivity alerts, activity progress updates, and bedtime notifications Descriptions of these notifications are provided below and can also be found inside the app when making changes to your notification preferences. The default settings provide notifications for low battery and inactivity. For notifications to appear: Your ring must be on your finger The app must be running in the background Your device's Bluetooth must be enabled Note that if you've toggled on specific notifications within your Oura App and they still aren't appearing as banner, lock screen, or notification center alerts on your device, you may need to check that Oura App notifications on your device are enabled as well. Enable Oura App Notifications on Your Device To start, go to your phone's Settings. For iOS : Tap Notifications > Scroll down, then tap on the Oura App > Ensure Allow Notifications is toggled on Optional : Under Options, you can also select Show Previews and change this setting to Always if you’d like your Oura notifications to show while your phone is locked. This may be useful in the case that you regularly use Face ID to unlock your phone, which may result in accidentally missing a notification For Android : Tap Apps & Notifications > Go to App Info > Tap the Oura App listed in this section Tap Notifications or App Notifications Do one of the following: Tap Show Notifications , then tap "On" Tap Allow Notifications Notification Specifics Here's what to expect from each notification: Battery Level If your ring's battery level is low, Oura will provide you with an alert 2-3 hours before your bedtime. If you receive this notification, be sure to charge your ring prior to falling asleep. You'll need at least a 30% battery charge prior to bed to receive sleep data the following morning. Inactivity Alerts Inactivity alerts will provide you with a friendly reminder to stretch your legs after 50 minutes of inactivity. When you receive this notification, you have 10 minutes to reset it. To do so, take a brief walk, or stretch for a few minutes. Activity Progress Oura will keep you updated on your daily activity goal progress with timely reminders. Keep in mind that your daily activity goal is determined by your readiness level, age, and sex. In order to keep your Activity Score high, we suggest you aim to reach your daily activity goals at least five times a week, which is where enabling this notification may be helpful. Bedtime Notifications Oura will provide a notification one hour prior to your suggested bedtime, so you can start unwinding with your nightly routine. Your bedtime guidance is calculated relative to the nights you’ve slept the longest and most efficiently, and can be updated on a daily basis to reflect your most recent sleep needs. Think of your bedtime guidance as Oura's reminder to hold you accountable to a consistent good night's sleep—if you happen to fall out of routine, bedtime notifications can help to bring you back into alignment. Troubleshooting Notifications Note for iOS members: iOS 18 includes a feature that lets you lock or hide apps. If the Oura App is locked or hidden, you won't receive notifications, and your widgets may also be hidden. For instructions on how to unlock or unhide the Oura App, refer to Apple's guide on locking or hiding apps . If you're not receiving notifications from the Oura App: Toggle all five notification settings off and then back on in the Oura App settings Toggle your device's Bluetooth on and off Restart your device Make sure your ring is not in Airplane Mode Ensure that your ring and the Oura App have synced at least once during the day Was this article helpful? 1787 out of 1945 found this helpful Return to top Related articles Ring Battery Tips Troubleshooting Gaps in Heart Rate Graphs Caring for Your Oura Ring Bedtime Guidance Product Safety & Use Social Our Company About Us Leadership Medical Advisory Board Careers Press The Pulse Blog Support My Account Sizing Oura on the Web Extra Charger Oura Memberships Contact © 2024 Oura Health Oy.

What Are Location Services? How to Use Location Services Things to Keep in Mind More Information What Are Location Services? By enabling location services on your Oura App, you'll gain access to a greater diversity of activity data, including route, distance, speed, and pace — depending on the type of activity you engage in. Setting up location tracking with Oura will help to improve the quality of your activity predictions over time. With more insights, you'll also gain deeper awareness into your daily activities and how they influence your sleep, recovery, and overall well being. These new metrics will be included in the "Activity Details" view of any confirmed activity to which route, distance, speed, or pace apply. You can access these after your activity by tapping on confirmed activities where they appear in either your home or Activity screens. Metrics include: Route: View a map with your start, end, and the exact path you've followed Distance: See the exact distance of your activity, in miles or kilometers Pace or speed ( depending on activity type ): Observe your average pace over the course of your activity and see your split times Automatic Activity Detection Metrics Route , distance , and speed are available for: Downhill skiing Ice skating Mountain biking Outdoor cycling Rollerblading Snowboarding Surfing Route , distance , and pace are available for: HIIT Hiking Horseback riding Nordic walking Orienteering Outdoor cross-country skiing Rowing Running Walking Distance is available for: Cross-training Outdoor climbing Note: You must have your phone on you while you work out in order for any location-based data to appear.

Please note that not all of these metrics will be accessible following the detection and confirmation of an activity with Oura. Only certain activities have applicable location data. Things to Keep in Mind As a best practice, we recommend setting Location Services for Oura to "Always on." In order for the feature to work optimally, your GPS location must be accessible from the very beginning of your activity. If not, you may end up missing your route and visual map. Note that this may result in higher phone battery consumption Your location data will never be shared outside your Oura App, or with a third party without your consent Route data and visual maps will also be available for manually added activities and activities imported through third-party app integrations , if your Location Services with Oura are established as "Always on," your phone is with you while you work out, and you open the Oura App on your device before starting an activity If you force quit your Oura App, location tracking will stop until you launch the app again More Information Automatic Activity Detection Manually Add an Activity How to Use Apple Health with Oura How to Use Health Connect by Android with Oura How to Use Strava with Oura Was this article helpful? 232 out of 337 found this helpful Return to top Related articles Lost Ring Cardio Capacity (VO2 Max) Automatic Activity Detection Ring Battery Tips Transfer Your Oura Data to a New Phone Social Our Company About Us Leadership Medical Advisory Board Careers Press The Pulse Blog Support My Account Sizing Oura on the Web Extra Charger Oura Memberships Contact © 2024 Oura Health Oy.

How to use Airplane Mode How to turn off Airplane Mode When to use Airplane Mode How to use Airplane Mode To enable Airplane Mode, tap the battery icon in the upper-right corner of the Oura App home screen. Then, toggle the slider next to "Ring airplane mode" on. Confirm that you’d like to turn on airplane mode via the pop-up message.

URL: https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057065433-Rest-Mode
Rest Mode – Oura Help Why Oura How It Works For Business Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Accessibility Why Oura How It Works For Business My Requests Shop Oura Help Oura App App Settings Articles in this section Managing Your Notifications Location Services for Activities Airplane Mode Rest Mode Power Saving Mode Oura App Languages Home Screen Quick Actions Set Up the Oura App How to Use the Oura App Troubleshooting Connection Issues Software Updates Rest Mode This article introduces Rest Mode, provides instructions on how to use it, and highlights a few best practices when you find yourself in need of some rest and relaxation. Rest Mode is available on the Oura App for iOS and Android. What is Rest Mode? How to Use Rest Mode Disable Rest Mode Using Tags While in Rest Mode Things to Keep in Mind What is Rest Mode? Rest Mode is a unique mode in the Oura App, designed for days when your body and mind need time to rest. This need for rest may be the result of an illness, an injury, or even jet lag. In general, though, Rest Mode can be used anytime you feel exhausted or overworked. By using Rest Mode, you’re proactively taking time to recover. For as long as you decide to keep Rest Mode on, your Activity Progress Goal, Activity Score, and all activity-related contributors will be disabled. Your Readiness and Sleep insights will also be adjusted to help you prioritize rest and recovery. Scenarios Where You Might Use Rest Mode Recovering from an illness, such as the flu or common cold Recuperating from a physical injury Experiencing excess stress or anxiety Experiencing joint/muscle pain or body cramps Recovering from jet lag Scenarios Rest Mode Isn't the Best For Attempting to detect or cure an illness or health condition Taking naps or watching television Meditating or practicing mindful breathing The guidance offered by Rest Mode helps you focus on rest and recovery during times when your body needs it the most. Rest Mode is not designed to cure or treat illnesses or other health conditions. How to Use Rest Mode There are two separate options you can use to enable Rest Mode. Option One Go to the menu in the upper-left corner of the Oura App home screen, then tap Rest Mode . Option Two Tap the Rest Mode notification card on the Oura home screen. This card will only appear if your average body temperature is elevated to the extent that your body temperature contributor suggests you pay attention. This suggestion might result if your body shows signs you’re under strain. You can expect to see the following notification card on the home screen if your average body temperature spikes. Once you’ve enabled Rest Mode and added any relevant tags, you’ll return to the home screen. The Oura App will indicate what in-app changes to expect while in Rest Mode. A Rest Mode notification will be visible at the bottom of the Oura App. This notification will remain until you choose to disable Rest Mode. Disable Rest Mode When you're ready to disable Rest Mode, you can tap the notification banner at the bottom of the home screen. You can also tap menu , then Rest Mode . If you want to remove any effect Rest Mode had on your Oura metrics, you can Turn off and delete tags. Using Tags While in Rest Mode A list of suggested tags will appear when you turn Rest Mode on. You can update tags linked to Rest Mode by tapping the notification banner at the bottom of the home screen, then tapping the edit icon. Rest Mode has a specific tag that will be automatically shown with other tags in Trends. The Rest Mode tag will appear when you enable Rest Mode and it cannot be removed. Any additional tags that you select for Rest Mode will appear as usual in Trends. During each day on Rest Mode, a notification card will appear asking if selected tags are still applicable. This daily notification allows you to track your symptoms and your progress. Things to Keep in Mind The automatic Rest Mode prompt relies on meaningful increases in average body temperature because body temperature is the clearest sign of strain amongst Oura metrics. Multiple factors can cause your average body temperature to be elevated such as illness, strain, your sleeping environment, or your menstrual cycle. Please note that Oura takes into account temperature changes that occur as a result of the natural menstrual cycle and, therefore, you will not be mistakenly prompted to turn on Rest Mode due to temperature elevations that result from a menstrual cycle. Once you turn Rest Mode off, your Oura App and any insights will gradually return to normal. This means that your Activity Goal, Score, and any activity-related contributors will slowly pick back up, taking into account the time you've spent in Rest Mode. This easing period lasts as long as Rest Mode was on, or a maximum of seven days. Although your Activity Goal, Score, and all activity-related contributors will be paused during Rest Mode, you’ll still be able to view your daily movement, inactive time, total burn, steps, and active calories with walking equivalency. Ensure your Oura Ring battery is at least 25% before going to bed. If you fall asleep with insufficient ring battery, you risk missing out on Readiness and Sleep insights while in Rest Mode.

Tips for Determining Your Oura Ring Size – Oura Help Why Oura How It Works For Business Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Accessibility Why Oura How It Works For Business My Requests Shop Oura Help Get Started Set Up Articles in this section Set Up an Oura Ring Change Password or Email Address Set Up the Oura App Tips for Determining Your Oura Ring Size How to Confirm Your Oura Ring Size User Guides Create an Oura Account Tips for Determining Your Oura Ring Size A properly fitting Oura Ring will ensure the highest possible data accuracy, comfort, and overall experience. Below are some tips to help you determine your ideal Oura Ring size with our sizing kit. The sizing for Oura Ring 4 is slightly different from Oura Ring Gen3. If you're switching between these different ring generations or uncertain about your size, make sure to use the right Oura Ring Sizing Kit for an accurate fit. The Oura Ring 4 Sizing Kit includes white ring sizers, and the Oura Ring Gen3 Sizing Kit includes black ring sizers. How to Choose Your Size How to Remove & Care for Your Ring Between Sizes? We don't offer the option to buy individual sizing kits from the Oura online store . If you choose the Size Later option, a sizing kit is included as part of your Oura Ring purchase. However, many authorized retailers sell sizing kits separately. When you purchase one, you'll receive a credit towards a future Oura Ring purchase from that retailer. Once you're finished with the sizing kit, you don't need to return it. Instead, feel free to pass it along to a friend or family member who might be interested in Oura. Otherwise, please recycle your sizing kit. If you received a sizing kit from a friend or family member or have already determined your Oura Ring size, you can select your size directly while purchasing. How to Choose Your Size Our ring sizers are meant to serve as guidelines for selecting your size and are not reflective of the quality and feel of the Oura Ring you'll receive after updating your order. 1. Open Your Sizing Kit Inside your sizing kit, you’ll find plastic ring sizers (sizes 4–15 for Oura Ring 4, sizes 6-13 for Gen3). Oura Ring sizes are slightly different than standard US ring sizes. We don't offer half sizes. Oura Ring and ring sizers are the same width and circumference. However, the Oura Ring itself weighs slightly more due to material differences. 2. Choose Your Finger The Oura Ring works on all fingers and can be worn on either hand. For optimal performance and accuracy, we recommend wearing your Oura Ring on your index finger. If you prefer another finger, the middle or ring fingers are the next best but try to avoid fingers with large knuckles (where the base of your finger is narrower than the knuckle). Try a few sizes on different fingers to find the ideal fit. You can move your ring between fingers and hands if you'd like or ever need to due to changes in finger size. 3. Confirm Ring Orientation Oura Ring 4 Wear the ring sizer with the size number visible on the top of the hand. Oura Ring Gen3: The sensor bumps inside the ring sizer should be on the pad (palm side) of your finger. 4. Ensure a Comfortable Fit Your Oura Ring should fit tightly and securely around the base of your finger. The right size is one that's comfortable to wear for extended periods and doesn't feel too tight during daily wear. The ring size you select shouldn't slide off easily but should come off with a bit of soap and water. 5. Test the Snugness Test the fit by making a fist while wearing your ring sizer. If you see a gap between the top of your finger and the inside of the ring, you might need a smaller size. 6. Wear for 24 Hours Your fingers expand and contract based on environmental factors, so we recommend wearing your ring sizer for at least 24 hours to confirm your best fit. Your ring should not rotate as you go about regular daily tasks. 7. Confirm Your Ring Size Once you've landed on your ideal size: If you bought your sizing kit from the Oura online store, sign in to My Account and confirm your Oura Ring size. You'll receive an email from us once your order has left our warehouses and is en route to you If you bought your sizing kit from an authorized retailer , return to the retailer and purchase your ring size How to Remove & Care for Your Ring To gently remove your ring, wash your hands with soap and water and slide the ring off your finger. Whenever you wash your hands with your Oura Ring on, you can follow these best practices to prevent irritation: Once you're done washing your hands, slide your Oura Ring up your finger and dry the base of your finger Next, slide your Oura Ring back down to the base of your finger and dry the area above your ring. This will help prevent water from becoming trapped underneath your ring Stuck Between Sizes? We recommend choosing the smaller of the two for the following reasons: Accuracy The sensors on the inside of your Oura Ring should always remain in contact with the pad of your finger. A more snug fit is known to create a stronger signal between the LED sensors inside your Oura Ring and the arteries beneath your skin by eliminating space/gaps. Materials Because our ring sizers are made of plastic, they may feel "stickier" on your skin and may not slide off as easily as the actual Oura Ring.

Apple Health is only available on iOS. For problems syncing Apple Health workouts with Oura, please see our Known Issues page. Setting Up Apple Health Data Synced with Apple Health Sleep Graphs in the Oura App vs. Apple Health Prioritize Oura for Steps App Integration Troubleshooting More Information Setting Up Apple Health While setting up your account after first downloading the Oura App, you'll have the option to enable Health. If you choose not to enable Health during the initial setup process, you can use the steps below to integrate the apps at any time. In the Oura App Tap the menu in the upper-left corner of the Oura App's home screen Tap Settings Under "Data sharing," tap Apple Health Enable the following parameters Connect to Health Save Mindful Minutes to Health Sharing settings can be adjusted by going to your phone's Settings > Health > Data Access & Devices > Oura On Your iPhone Once your Oura App is connected to Apple Health, you can adjust what data is shared between them at any time: Open Apple Health Tap your profile picture in the upper-right corner of the Apple Health app Under "Privacy," select Apps Select Oura Select which categories you'd like to share between Oura and Apple Health Data Synced with Apple Health When you sync your Oura data, Apple Health updates will appear after you've completed an activity or workout. You can choose to import and export the following data: Exported from Oura to Apple Health Active Energy: activity burn calories, excluding your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) Heart Rate: in one-minute intervals Height Mindful Minutes Respiratory Rate: average nighttime respiratory rate Resting Energy Sleep Sleep Duration Start Time End Time Sleep Stages Steps Weight Workouts: manually added , recorded through Activity Heart Rate , or added with Automatic Activity Detection Workout Active Calories Workout Distance Workout Duration (Start time and End time) Workout Type Workouts exported from Oura will contribute to both the Move and Exercise rings . The Exercise ring increases by the workout's total duration, and the Move ring increases by the number of active calories burned. Please note: steps in Oura do not move the Stand Ring because of a limitation from Apple. Imported from Apple Health to Oura Date of Birth Height Sex Weight Workout Routes Workouts Workout Calories Workout Distance Workout Duration (Start time and End time) Workout Type You can find more information about Oura & Apple Health on our blog . Sleep Graphs in the Oura App vs. Apple Health Your sleep stages graph may appear differently in the Oura App compared to Apple Health. We use the most accurate data available for metrics like time asleep and sleep stage durations, and this same data is exported to Apple Health. The Oura App hypnogram displays sleep data using five-minute intervals, optimizing for readability while still accurately reflecting sleep stage trends. Apple may apply slight rounding or display sleep graphs using different time intervals, which can result in variations between the two views. Prioritize Oura for Steps You can set Oura as a priority data source for steps recorded in Apple Health. This will mitigate the problem of your steps being double counted if you use more than one fitness device at the same time. Open the Health app on your iPhone Select the Browse tab in the bottom right corner Select Activity Select Steps Scroll to the bottom and select Data Sources & Access Select Edit in the upper right corner Under Data Sources , press and hold the icon next to Oura Drag Oura to the top of the list If the double-counting problem persists, you can opt-out of sharing your steps data from Oura entirely by going to your phone's Settings > Health > Data Access & Devices > Oura > Allow "Oura" to Write > Toggle "Steps" off. Keep in mind: Other wearables or apps may show different step estimates than Oura because they use a different method of categorizing steps. Many trackers set a different threshold for what counts as "activity" while others categorize all movements as steps. App Integration Troubleshooting If you are having trouble syncing data between Oura and a third-party app, please try the following troubleshooting steps. Reset Integration Please make sure your phone is on the latest version of its operating system, and follow these steps: Open the Oura App Tap the menu in the upper-left corner Tap Settings Scroll down to "Data Sharing" and select the appropriate app integration Turn all the settings switches off and then turn them back on As a final step, turn your device on and off again before trying to import another activity through the integration. Reinstall Oura App To backup and reinstall the Oura App: Open the Oura App Select the menu in the upper-left corner Tap Settings Scroll down to "Account" Select "Back up all data" When the back up is finished, uninstall and reinstall the Oura App Other Troubleshooting If you link your Oura App to a third party app such as Apple Health or Health Connect by Android , your height, weight, age, and sex will be imported from those apps into Oura, and you will not be able to edit them unless you unlink the apps. The Oura App might not import data from integrations if both apps were not opened before midnight, if "Background App Refresh" is disabled, or if "Lower Power Mode" is enabled. Open both Oura and the integrated app at least once a day to prevent this. The Oura App will only sync activities for the current day. If you are having trouble syncing your activity, verify that "Date Added" matches the date on which the activity occurred. If the imported activity includes calorie data, you can't manually edit the data in the Oura App. Edit the calorie info through the app used to track your activity. When tracking activity, Oura only records your active calories. These calories include the calories you burn during exercise and not your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR, the number of calories required to keep your body functioning while at rest). Other fitness trackers and health apps will combine active calories and BMR. As a result, their calorie burn estimations may differ slightly from Oura's. If you are still experiencing trouble, please contact us. You can contact our Member Care Team here .

On the Apple Watch, you can add circular, rectangular, and corner complications that display your Oura data, including: Scores Activity goal progress Ring battery level Heart rate, movement, sleep, and average body temperature graphs How to Use the Apple Watch Companion App Installing the Companion App Ensure that your Apple Watch is paired and synced to your iPhone, and that both the iPhone and Apple Watch software are up-to-date. View these instructions from Apple for more information on how to pair and sync your Apple Watch and iPhone. Make sure the Oura App on your iPhone is at least version 4.8.1, then use one of the methods below to install Oura's companion app on your Apple Watch. Method 1: Watch App on iPhone Open the Watch app on your iPhone From the My Watch tab, scroll down to find Oura under Available Apps Tap Install next to Oura and wait for it to complete Method 2: Watch App on iPhone Open the Watch app on iOS From the Discover tab, select Explore Watch Apps Search for Oura Select GET and wait for the download to complete Method 3: Apple Watch directly (without iPhone) Select the app tray and open > App Store Search for Oura in the App Store Select GET Note: After installation, the iOS Oura App will need to be launched at least once before Oura data will appear in the Apple Watch companion app. Installing Apple Watch Complications More instructions on customizing your Apple Watch display can be found here . Complications can only be added to watch faces that support them. If you do not see an option to add complications on yours, you may need to select and install a different watch face. Tap and hold the Apple Watch face Select Edit Tap and hold corner complications or tap circular and rectangular complications to change them Scroll through the options and tap the desired Oura complication Save by pressing the digital crown once Note: Complications use additional Apple Watch battery life. Syncing Your Oura Data The Apple Watch app is a companion to the iOS Oura App, and does not pair to the ring directly. You must open the Oura App on the iPhone and sync with your ring in order for data to update on the Apple Watch. Oura data does not automatically update on the Apple Watch app in real time. If your Apple Watch app shows dashes instead of scores, measurements, or contributors, this likely means that you have not synced your ring in several days, and there is no available data. Open the Oura App on your iPhone and wait for your ring to update its data. Some user actions such as recording activity heart rate or adding a tag are not available through the Apple Watch companion app. If your Oura App is in Rest Mode, readiness and sleep information will be available, but the Activity Score will be disabled.

Veri Acquisition CGM Integrations with Oura Dexcom and Oura Strategic Partnership More Information What Are Continuous Glucose Monitors? A continuous glucose monitor is a wearable device worn on the back of the upper arm to track interstitial glucose levels. Glucose levels indicate how your body responds to certain foods, and monitoring them can provide insights into your sleep and recovery patterns. High or low glucose levels can cause sleep disturbances. Likewise, low-quality sleep may also impair glucose metabolism. To learn more about how sleep quality and glucose levels affect each other, check out our blog post . Veri Acquisition Oura has acquired Veri , a metabolic health company. Oura's strategy is to be a personal health companion, and to do that, we will continue to add new dimensions, as we've done with Heart Health and Women's Health, to the Oura experience. Metabolic health is the natural next dimension of that experience and Veri is a key part of unlocking that dimension. CGM Integrations with Oura Currently, three CGM companies include the ability use Oura Ring data within their apps: January January’s app uses data from a continuous glucose monitor and any compatible activity tracker (including the Oura Ring) to provide glucose predictions and real-time behavior insights. For more information on how it works, see the January website . Supersapiens (Europe only) The Supersapiens app can use sleep data from an Oura Ring to chart the impact of glucose on sleep, and vice versa. Activity metrics can also be imported from Oura into Supersapiens. For more information on this integration, see the Supersapiens help article . Dexcom and Oura Strategic Partnership Through a strategic partnership, Dexcom and Oura plan to launch integrations enabling data to flow between Dexcom and Oura products, including Dexcom glucose biosensors, Dexcom apps, Oura Ring, and the Oura App. Read more about the partnership here.

How to Use the Oura API How to Generate Personal Access Tokens How to Use Personal Access Tokens More Information What Is the Oura API? The Oura API can be used to fetch your Oura data or build an integration that allows anyone to share their Oura data with a third-party service. The Oura API V1 was released in 2016 and the Oura API V2 released in January 2022. Support for V1 was discontinued in early 2023. How to Use the Oura API Full documentation for Oura API V2 can be found here . Gen3 Oura Ring users without active Oura Membership will no longer be able to access their data through the Oura API. Furthermore, partner applications that are integrated with the Oura API will no longer have access to the data of Oura Ring Generation 3 users who do not have active Oura Membership. However, all Oura users will still be able to easily download their data files through Oura on the Web . At a minimum, these data files will comply with GDPR request requirements . Oura users must have updated to a recent version of the Oura mobile app to support new data types that are available through the Oura API V2. Existing access tokens from the Oura API V1 will remain valid for use with the Oura API V2 for personal information, daily activity, daily readiness, daily sleep, and bedtime data. Existing access tokens from the Oura API V1 will not have access to any new data types available through the Oura API V2, including daytime heart rate measurement, workout heart rate, workouts, tags, sessions, and other data types that will be released in the future.

Symptom Radar is available for: Oura Ring Generation 3 and Oura Ring 4 with active membership ( not available on Gen2 or older) iOS and Android Members with at least seven nights of sleep data within the past 14 days What Is Symptom Radar? How to Use Symptom Radar More Information What Is Symptom Radar? Symptom Radar looks for changes in your Oura data that may indicate something is putting a strain on your body. The Oura App monitors several biometrics including average body temperature , respiratory rate , resting heart rate , heart rate variability , and inactive time—significant deviations in one or more of these metrics may be a sign for you to focus on rest and recovery in the upcoming days. Symptom Radar also uses demographic information such as your age, sex assigned at birth, height, and weight to better tailor its recommendations to you. To ensure your information is correct, tap the menu in the upper-left corner of the home screen and select My profile. The Oura Ring is not a medical device and is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, monitor, or prevent medical conditions or illnesses. Please do not make any changes to your medication, nutrition, or workouts without first consulting your doctor or another medical professional. Symptom Radar may not work optimally with pre-existing medical conditions . Pregnancy also impacts biometric baselines and may reduce the accuracy of Symptom Radar. How to Use Symptom Radar Symptom Radar is turned on by default and visible to Oura members with active membership. Among other inputs, the feature uses your sleep data (at least seven nights within the past 14 days) to check for signs of strain on your body. If there is a clear sign of strain, it will be spotlighted on the Today screen the following morning. In that case, you can tap on the Symptom Radar card to see more detail. You can also access Symptom Radar at any time by selecting the menu in the upper-left of the Today screen and then selecting Symptom Radar . The Oura App displays signs of strain in a three-level estimate: No signs : There are no obvious signs in your biometrics of something straining your body Minor signs : There are small signs in your biometrics of something straining your body Major signs : There are stronger signs in your biometrics of something straining your body If there are minor or major signs of strain, the Oura App will recommend focusing on rest and recovery and will display the biometrics that are showing the most change. If needed, you can enable Rest Mode , which pauses your Activity Score , goal, and all activity contributors. Symptom Radar will continue to monitor your metrics even with Rest Mode activated.

Readiness Score – Oura Help Why Oura How It Works For Business Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Accessibility Why Oura How It Works For Business My Requests Shop Oura Help Oura App App Features Readiness Articles in this section Symptom Radar Readiness Score Readiness Contributors Daytime Stress Resilience Resting Heart Rate Respiratory Rate Heart Rate Variability Body Temperature Readiness Score This article covers how Oura measures your Readiness Score, what's considered a "good" score, quick tips on how to improve your readiness, and the various factors that may result in lower Readiness Scores. What Is the Readiness Score? How Oura Measures Readiness What Is a Good Readiness Score? What Is the Crown Icon? How to Improve Your Readiness Score Factors That May Decrease Your Readiness Score What Is the Readiness Score? Your Readiness Score reflects how balanced your recovery and activity are. It looks at your sleep quality, body signals, and activity levels to show how prepared you are to take on the day. How Oura Measures Readiness The Readiness Score looks at both short-term and long-term metrics, or your Readiness Contributors . Overnight metrics include the lowest resting heart rate and its timing, average body temperature, sleep quality, and physical movement from the previous day. Long-term metrics include HRV, sleep, and activity balance. Readiness Contributors with "balance" in their name, such as Activity Balance, HRV Balance, and Sleep Balance, use 14-day weighted averages. They compare your recent 14-day average (with the past 2–5 days having slightly more weight) to your long-term average over the past two months. For example, your Activity Balance compares how much physical load you've taken on over the past 14 days to what your body is used to over the past two months. If you had an intense workout yesterday, it will have a bigger impact on your Activity Balance than a workout from a week ago. Readiness Score also takes into account natural biometric fluctuations during the menstrual cycle . What Is a Good Readiness Score? Readiness, Activity, and Sleep Scores — and their contributors — are rated on a scale of 0-100. 85-100: Optimal 70-84: Good 60-69: Fair 0-59: Pay Attention An 85 or higher may be a sign that you are ready to take on new challenges. Scores below 70 indicate that you may benefit from prioritizing rest and recovery in the indicated areas. Some variation in your Readiness Score is a good thing. It shows you're challenging your body in healthy ways. A manageable amount of stress can help build metabolic and cardiovascular strength. The key is to push yourself, recover, and repeat this cycle to support long-term well-being. What Is the Crown Icon? On days when your Readiness, Sleep, or Activity Score is 85 or higher, you'll see a crown icon next to your Readiness, Sleep, or Activity Scores. How to Improve Your Readiness Score If you’re looking to improve your Readiness Score and support recovery, here are a few tips for today to improve your Readiness tomorrow: Try to limit intense physical activity, but don't stay completely inactive either. Opt for light movement that gets your body moving without adding strain, such as a 20-minute walk, light yoga, or stretching Take it easy, but try not to sit for long periods. Aim to avoid sitting for more than five hours if possible, and incorporate movement throughout your day Factors That May Decrease Your Readiness Score 1. High or low body temperatures High average body temperatures may be a sign of stress on the body, such as illness Low average body temperatures may be a sign of changes in your system, such as those that take place during the female menstrual cycle. Lower body temperatures have been shown to occur during the follicular phase (the 14-day period leading up to ovulation) 2. High or low resting heart rates (RHR) A higher-than-usual RHR suggests that your body is over-challenged and not recovering properly A lower-than-usual RHR may indicate low arousal of your nervous system, meaning your body isn't being challenged enough to maintain physical fitness. This could lead to feelings of lethargy 3. High or low Heart rate variability (HRV) Significantly higher-than-normal HRV might indicate low nervous system arousal Lower-than-normal HRV can be a sign of excessive stress or strain on your body. 4. Consistently insufficient sleep According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine guidelines, the average adult (18+ years) needs 7-9 hours of sleep per night for optimal health 5. Higher or lower Activity Balance Higher Activity Balance may indicate that you are overexerting and pushing yourself too hard Lower Activity Balance may indicate that you are not challenging your body enough 6. Late heart rate stabilization Heart rate stabilization happens when your RHR stays within 3 beats per minute (BPM) of your lowest RHR for the night. Heart rate stabilization typically occurs before your RHR reaches its lowest point. Ideally, this happens earlier in the night, giving your body more time to recover Read more about the Readiness Score on The Pulse Blog .

Readiness Contributors – Oura Help Why Oura How It Works For Business Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Accessibility Why Oura How It Works For Business My Requests Shop Oura Help Oura App App Features Readiness Articles in this section Symptom Radar Readiness Score Readiness Contributors Daytime Stress Resilience Resting Heart Rate Respiratory Rate Heart Rate Variability Body Temperature Readiness Contributors Your Readiness Score uses data from nine contributors to indicate how ready you are for the upcoming day. Readiness contributors are based on your personal averages. It can take up to two weeks for the Oura App to learn your average values for each contributor listed below. Once average ranges are established, your daily readings are evaluated against them. Keep in mind that "long-term" refers to personal data collected over the past two months. Resting Heart Rate HRV Balance Body Temperature Recovery Index Sleep Sleep Balance Sleep Regularity Previous Day Activity Activity Balance Readiness Score and Contributor Ratings More Information Resting Heart Rate The Resting heart rate (RHR) contributor evaluates the lowest heart rate from the previous night against the long-term average heart rate to determine fluctuations that may indicate physiological stress or strain, illness, or other health factors. Average resting heart rates between 40-100 beats per minute (BPM) are considered normal. Your RHR contributor score may decline if you have an RHR that's 3-5 BPM higher or 10-15 BPM lower than your usual average. If you notice higher than usual or exceptionally low nighttime heart rates, this could be a sign of stress or illness. Late night meals, caffeine, alcohol, or exercise before bedtime can also contribute to a high resting heart rate. HRV Balance Heart Rate Variability (HRV) balance compares your average HRV from the past 14 days against your three-month average, with data from the past few days being weighted more. HRV balance is a measure of your stress and recovery, and can highlight the negative effects of prolonged stressors (such as overtraining or illness) and the positive effects of recovery-based activities and rest. HRV balance insights will sometimes appear on your home screen to inform you of ideal days to engage in challenging, light, or limited activity. Following these suggestions can help you boost or take advantage of your current HRV balance score. This contributor is not the same as the HRV rating (pay attention, fair, good, or optimal) shown in Trends , which reflects your average HRV over the past seven days as compared to your long-term average. Body Temperature This contributor compares the change in your previous night's body temperature to your average, long-term nighttime body temperature . For long-term averages, temperatures between 95.9 - 99.3°F (35.5 - 37.4°C) are considered normal. Daily fluctuations in average body temperature are typical, but when they extend beyond your personal average, you’ll see a decrease in your Readiness Score. Significant changes in average body temperature may indicate illness or other physiological strain, the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, or a change in pregnancy status. These changes will affect the Readiness Score if they extend beyond personal baseline temperatures. To learn more, check out our article on Body Temperature . Recovery Index Recovery Index measures the time spent sleeping after the heart rate lowers to its lowest point during the night. Optimal Recovery Index requires a minimum of six hours of sleep after this point. Having six hours of sleep, or more, after your heart rate reaches its lowest point will lead to a boost in your Readiness Score, so it is beneficial for your RHR to reach its lowest point within the first half of the night. If you notice your heart rate consistently reaching its lowest point in the second half of the night, try avoiding late night meals, caffeine, alcohol, or exercise before bedtime. Sleep The Sleep contributor compares your total sleep from the past 24 hours (confirmed naps included) against your baseline. This is a measure of your short-term sleep, whereas the Sleep balance contributor is a measure of your long-term sleep. You can find tips on how to increase your Sleep Score in this article . Sleep Balance The Sleep Balance contributor assesses the amount of sleep and possible sleep debt over the past two weeks compared to your baseline and general recommendations for people of your age. You'll see a decrease in your Sleep Balance score if you’re sleeping less than you normally do or less than the recommended average for someone your age.The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends that the average adult sleep between 7-9 hours per night. Sleep Regularity The Sleep regularity contributor measures how consistent your bedtime and wake-up times have been during the previous two weeks. Sleep regularity is not impacted by any naps. If your score drops to "Fair" or "Pay attention," try to find a wake-up time you can stick with on most days and adjust your bedtime accordingly. If that's not possible, try to make sure that you get enough sleep for your needs on most days. Previous Day Activity Previous Day Activity measures all of your activities and sedentary (inactive) time from the day before, and compares them with your long-term averages and recommended daily amounts of physical movement. Your Readiness Score will decrease if you were inactive during the previous day. Having 5-8 hours or less of inactivity each day will have a positive effect on your Activity and Readiness Scores. This contributor will also decrease if heavy activity places too much strain on your body. This will be an indicator to use the next day as recovery time. Activity Balance Activity Balance compares your average activity levels over the past 14 days (with the past few days holding more weight) to your long-term activity levels over the past two months. Lower Activity Balance scores indicate either a training overload or underload . The goal should be to balance your low, medium, and high-intensity activities . Readiness Score and Contributor Ratings Readiness, Activity, and Sleep Scores — and their contributors — are rated on a scale of 0-100. 85-100: Optimal 70-84: Good 60-69: Fair 0-59: Pay Attention An 85 or higher may be a sign that you are ready to take on new challenges. Scores below 70 indicate that you may benefit from prioritizing rest and recovery in the indicated areas. Learn more about your Readiness Score and contributors on our blog .

Daytime Stress – Oura Help Why Oura How It Works For Business Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Accessibility Why Oura How It Works For Business My Requests Shop Oura Help Oura App App Features Readiness Articles in this section Symptom Radar Readiness Score Readiness Contributors Daytime Stress Resilience Resting Heart Rate Respiratory Rate Heart Rate Variability Body Temperature Daytime Stress Daytime Stress enables you to track your individual physiological stress during waking hours so that you can understand, manage, and recover from it more effectively. This feature is not available for Gen2 or older. What Is Daytime Stress? How Daytime Stress Works Things to Keep in Mind More Information What Is Daytime Stress? Stress is your body's natural response to both internal and external challenges and is neither inherently good nor bad. Everyone feels stress, but the causes are highly personal — work, jetlag, social interactions, and stimulants like coffee can all be stressors on the body. Daytime Stress measures your heart rate, HRV , motion, and average body temperature throughout the day to provide ongoing insights into your physiological stress. Your stress will be categorized into one of four zones: Stressed: The highest level. Common and normal, but a sign to seek Restorative Time Engaged: Some elevated signs of stress, but potentially good for productivity Relaxed: Your body has moved from a state of stress into one of mild recovery Restored: Your body is recharging in a pure state of calm How Daytime Stress Works Daytime Stress measures your physiological stress responses, which include both physical and mental responses and adaptation to different internal and external factors. Internal factors, for example, can include a lack of sleep or illness. External factors can include things like work-related stress, alcohol, or social activities. Your Daytime Stress information can be found on a home card each day, where you'll see a real-time stress graph. The stress graph is color-coded to help you easily visualize your latest detected state, and it updates every 15 minutes during periods when you're awake, wearing your ring, and relatively inactive. You must have five days of data in order to see Daytime Stress results. Your HRV reflects the activities of your autonomous nervous system, which regulates how your body adapts to stressors. Daytime Stress inspects your HRV, among other measurements, relative to your personalized baseline. Your baseline is adjusted with new data every day as long as the data is available. For more information about HRV and stress, see HRV and Stress: What HRV Can Tell You About Your Mental Health . Contextual Stress You can tap the home card to be taken to a detail view with additional information. This detail view includes two toggles: one for "Daily movement" and one for "Tags and activities." Toggling these will create an overlay on the daily stress graph that can help provide additional context about the relationship between activity and stress. The daily movement graph is identical to the movement graph on the Activity screen . Daytime Stress analysis is not available during physical activity as physiological stress and recovery states can only be measured during no or low movement periods. Tags and activities are marked on the graph's timeline. Tap on a tag to highlight it on the graph. You can also add a tag directly from the Daytime Stress screen. Below the insight message are totals for your day's Stressed and Restored times. Tapping on either will take you to that metric's graph in Trends . Gaps in Stress Graph Daytime Stress is only calculated during waking hours. You will see stress data on the Oura App's home screen after you wake up and enough data has been collected, along with various insights displayed throughout the day. In the evening you will see a daily summary, and you can also scroll back to see insights from the previous days. If you see gaps in your Daytime Stress graph, these may be possible reasons: Your stress isn't measured during movement, including workouts. When periods of movement are over, you'll see their impact on your stress graph Your stress isn't measured during sleep You weren't wearing your ring for a period of time Your ring wasn't able to measure your heart rate due to a poor or loose fit You had cold hands, which can cause signal problems Things to Keep in Mind Daytime Stress results may not be valid for users with heart diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, or pacemakers You must wear your ring during the day and night to establish your baselines for Daytime Stress results If you are a new member, or a returning member who has not worn their ring for a prolonged amount of time, it may take 5-7 days of regular day and night use to establish your baselines and daytime stress data to show Daytime Stress cannot differentiate different stress sources, as the body physiologically reacts the same way to different stressors, whether it's physical or mental. You can also do a self-reflection each day using Reflections or add and view tags in your trends view to track your daily actions and behavior More Information Track, Understand, and Manage Your Stress With Oura Reframing Stress: The Difference Between "Bad" and "Good" Stress Heart Rate Variability Heart Rate Graph Troubleshooting Gaps in Heart Rate Graphs Reflections Daily Movement Graph Using Tags Using Trends Was this article helpful? 328 out of 573 found this helpful Return to top Related articles Heart Rate Variability Resilience Restorative Time Cardiovascular Age Daily Movement Graph Social Our Company About Us Leadership Medical Advisory Board Careers Press The Pulse Blog Support My Account Sizing Oura on the Web Extra Charger Oura Memberships Contact © 2024 Oura Health Oy.

Resilience – Oura Help Why Oura How It Works For Business Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Accessibility Why Oura How It Works For Business My Requests Shop Oura Help Oura App App Features Readiness Articles in this section Symptom Radar Readiness Score Readiness Contributors Daytime Stress Resilience Resting Heart Rate Respiratory Rate Heart Rate Variability Body Temperature Resilience Stress Resilience is an estimate of your ability to withstand physiological stress and recover from it over time. While Daytime Stress helps measure your physiological stress throughout the day, Resilience helps you understand how effectively you're balancing your stress load with recovery throughout the day and night. The feature is not available to Gen2 and older. What Is Resilience? How Resilience Works How to Use Resilience Things to Keep In Mind More Information What Is Resilience? Oura determines your resilience to stress by looking at how well you're balancing stress and recovery in recent weeks using your Daytime Stress levels, daily restorative time , and how well you recover during sleep . Your Resilience level is not specific to a certain day but instead reflects your ongoing balance of physiological stress and recovery throughout the day and night based on a 14-day average. This equilibrium is crucial in ensuring that stress does not have a long-term negative impact on your well-being. Recovery is a key factor in determining resilience, and a robust recovery system can help someone manage and bounce back from stressful situations more effectively. As your Readiness Score is a holistic picture of your health, and Resilience takes into account some of the Readiness Contributors (HRV balance, recovery index, and resting heart rate), Resilience and Readiness are correlated with each other. Therefore, if your Readiness Score is high for a longer period of time, you will likely also see an increase in your Resilience level. However, a single day of bad sleep and a low Readiness Score will not significantly affect your Resilience level. How Resilience Works Since Resilience is a long-term metric, you must have at least five days of complete data (daytime data followed by a sleep period) within the past 14 days. For new members, it will take at least 10 days before your Oura Ring establishes your personal stress and recovery baselines to estimate your Resilience. Your Resilience level is estimated by taking into account stress and recovery contributors measured over the last 14 days: Daytime stress load: uses heart rate, HRV , motion, and average body temperature during the day to determine physiological stress during the day (See also Inside the Ring: Understanding Oura's New Daytime Stress Feature ) Daytime recovery (also referred to as Restorative Time ) Nighttime recovery: Uses your Sleep Score, resting heart rate, HRV balance, and Recovery Index Each contributor has its own levels. The Daytime Stress load contributor is classified as low, moderate, or high. The Daytime recovery and Nighttime recovery contributors are categorized the same as Readiness Contributors: Pay attention, Fair, Good, and Optimal. How to Use Resilience Resilience is a long-term metric that changes gradually over the days and weeks. Your daily update is available as soon as you wake up. You can see your Resilience level via a card on the home screen or by going to the My Health tab. Your Resilience levels fall within five categories: Exceptional: You've achieved an ideal balance of physiological stress and recovery. Strong: Your body is in a great place to deal with upcoming challenges thanks to your strong recent balance of physiological stress and recovery. Solid: Your balance of physiological stress and recovery has been good of late, and your body is in a nice spot to deal with upcoming challenges. Just be sure to follow any increases in stress with some extra rest. Adequate: You’re hanging in there, but your resilience is not quite where you want it to be long-term. Check in on your balance of physiological stress and recovery to see if there’s a small adjustment that could help. Limited: There’s a clear gap between the recovery your body is getting and the recovery it needs to balance your recent levels of physiological stress. Within the Resilience detail view, you explore each Resilience Contributor and view two graphs to help visualize your data. Checking your individual Resilience Contributor scores can help guide you on where to focus to improve the amount and quality of your recovery to balance out your stress. . The Trend graph shows the direction of your resilience over the past few days. Each dot on the graph represents one day. The Map graph shows your balance between stress and recovery over the past 14 days. The dots represent individual days and can long-press on each level to see where the dots fall on the Resilience scale. Things to Keep in Mind In order to receive Resilience updates, you'll need to wear your ring regularly during the day and night. Make sure the ring sits well on your finger, and try other fingers if the ring is too loose, as this might affect the daytime metrics coverage Resilience is a highly individual metric, and changes in Resilience level can also be seasonal. On average, your Resilience level changes about 2-3 times a month, and this is influenced by individual physiology and lifestyle habits. Both the levels and changes are highly personal For new members, Daytime Stress needs to be calculated before Resilience levels are shown, which can take at least 10 days Members should be at least on software versions iOS 5.2.0 and Android 5.2.0 More Information Daytime Stress Inside the Ring: Understanding Oura's New Daytime Stress Feature Building Resilience: Improve Your Ability to Recover From Stress Inside the Ring: Resilience Rest & Resilience: The Role of Sleep in Stress Management 4 Ways Oura’s Resilience Feature Helps This Member Recover from Stress Readiness Score Was this article helpful? 225 out of 276 found this helpful Return to top Related articles Daytime Stress Readiness Score Restorative Time Oura Ring Generation 3 Software Updates for iOS Social Our Company About Us Leadership Medical Advisory Board Careers Press The Pulse Blog Support My Account Sizing Oura on the Web Extra Charger Oura Memberships Contact © 2024 Oura Health Oy.

Resting Heart Rate – Oura Help Why Oura How It Works For Business Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Accessibility Why Oura How It Works For Business My Requests Shop Oura Help Oura App App Features Readiness Articles in this section Symptom Radar Readiness Score Readiness Contributors Daytime Stress Resilience Resting Heart Rate Respiratory Rate Heart Rate Variability Body Temperature Resting Heart Rate Learn more about the Resting Heart Rate (RHR) measurements taken by the Oura Ring. What Is Resting Heart Rate? How Oura Measures Resting Heart Rate When Does Oura Measure Resting Heart Rate? Interpret Your Resting Heart Rate What Is Resting Heart Rate? Resting Heart Rate (RHR) is the number of times your heart beats per minute while you're at rest. It provides a snapshot of your sleep quality, recovery, stress response, activity level, and overall health. Normal RHR in adults can range anywhere from 40-100 beats per minute (BPM). Oura develops an individualized baseline for your RHR so you can quickly notice when something is off. Variation beyond 3-5 BPM above or below your personal average may be a sign of low recovery or excessive stress on your body, such as illness, poor diet choices, late-night eating, or lack of sleep. The Importance of Resting Heart Rate Resting heart rate is an indicator of both long and short-term health. In the long term , a low RHR is generally a sign of better cardiovascular health, physical fitness, and recovery In the short term , a high RHR can indicate behaviors you can control, such as internal stress, eating patterns, or exercise habits. These can be positive or negative, depending on the context. For example, completing a difficult workout is a positive precursor to an elevated RHR. Meanwhile, undergoing mental distress from work is generally viewed as a negative source of rises in RHR A Lower RHR is a Good Sign With each heartbeat, your body uses the oxygen-rich blood collected from your lungs to support functions throughout your systems. When your resting heart rate lowers over time, each heartbeat becomes more effective. This allows your body to accomplish the same amount of work necessary to keep itself running with less effort. As your heart becomes more efficient, you're able to do more without increasing your heart rate, allowing your body to take on less strain. With less strain, your body moves closer to a parasympathetic ("rest-and-digest") state. The more that your parasympathetic nervous system dominates, the more room there is for your sympathetic nervous system (fight-or-flight) to come into action when needed. This might be necessary when you decide to exercise, give a presentation, interview for a new job, try something for the first time, or have to meet a deadline at work. How Oura Measures Resting Heart Rate Oura monitors your RHR by detecting changes in your blood pulse volume through infrared photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors found inside your ring. Each time that your heart beats, blood is pumped out to the arteries located in your hands and fingers. The PPG sensors are able to detect these changes in blood flow and volume using light reflection. Each pulse causes the arteries in your finger to alternate between swelling and contracting. By shining a light on your skin, changes in light reflected back from the wavering volume of red blood cells in your arteries are accounted for. From here, PPG can represent these blood flow changes through a visual waveform that represents the activity of your heart. Oura provides you with the following RHR metrics: Average RHR: Your average RHR captured during the night Lowest RHR: Your lowest RHR value captured during the night Your RHR values are captured every 10 minutes throughout the night. You can find your RHR in your Readiness and Sleep detail views and in Trends . When Does Oura Measure Resting Heart Rate? The Oura Ring Gen2 doesn't track heart rate during exercise or other activities during the day. The only exception is during unguided sessions , which allow you to meditate or check in with your body. Certain unguided sessions, upon completion, show you a snapshot of your RHR during the day. Also, read more information about our 24-hour heart rate graph . Interpret Your Resting Heart Rate Low vs. High, Compared to Your Average If your lowest RHR of the night is roughly 0-10 BPM below your personal long-term average (collected over the past ~ 2 months), this is evidence that your body has recovered well and is in an optimal state to perform that day. However, an exceptionally low resting heart rate may indicate that you are in a state of low nervous system arousal or lethargy after a very strenuous physical peak performance. You'll observe decreased Readiness Scores if you receive an RHR that is 10-15 BPM lower than usual, as well as if you receive an RHR that is 3-5 BPM higher than usual. An elevated RHR is a sign that something is challenging your system to a degree that’s leading to poor recovery. Both of these scenarios are signs to pay attention and give your body the care and time that it needs to recover properly. Patterns in Your RHR If your RHR reaches its lowest point during the first half of your night, it can be a sign you've recovered well from the previous day. This ideal pattern is known as "The Hammock," which you'll see demonstrated below. For information about other RHR patterns that can occur at night, see Sleeping Heart Rate: Look for These 4 Patterns . This ties into the concept of heart rate stabilization, which divides sleep into two phases: repair and recharge. During repair, your body recovers from the previous day. During recharge, your body prepares for the coming day. Once your heart rate reaches its lowest point during the night (known as stabilization), your body transitions from repair to recharge. The sooner your heart rate can reach its true nighttime low, the more time your body has to refuel and get ready for the day ahead.

Respiratory Rate – Oura Help Why Oura How It Works For Business Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Accessibility Why Oura How It Works For Business My Requests Shop Oura Help Oura App App Features Readiness Articles in this section Symptom Radar Readiness Score Readiness Contributors Daytime Stress Resilience Resting Heart Rate Respiratory Rate Heart Rate Variability Body Temperature Respiratory Rate Learn more about how Oura measures your respiratory rate, how to interpret changes in your respiratory rate, and about the accuracy of our approach. How Oura Measures Respiratory Rate Interpret Your Respiratory Rate The Accuracy of Oura's Respiratory Rate How Oura Measures Respiratory Rate The respiratory rate displayed in your Oura App shows how many breaths you took per minute during the previous night, on average. This value can be found in your Readiness tab, as well as in Trends . Oura estimates respiratory rate at rest via minute-by-minute changes in your nighttime heart rate. This calculation is possible because your heart and lungs are closely connected by a process called respiratory sinus arrhythmia. This relationship reveals the following: When you breathe in, your heart rate increases. When you breathe out, your heart rate slows down. Because Oura is able to accurately measure the pulse waveform produced by each of your heartbeats using the PPG sensors located inside your ring, it can also correctly measure the distance between consecutive heartbeats in milliseconds. This distance is otherwise known as the interbeat interval (IBI). If you’re familiar with heart rate variability (HRV), IBIs are the building blocks of HRV. By mapping out IBI values over the course of a night, an "up and down" pattern will gradually form. In direct opposition to the respiratory sinus arrhythmia relationship described earlier, when you observe IBI values decreasing, this signals that you're breathing in. When you observe IBI values increasing, this signals that you’re breathing out. Each increase and decrease that occur together in the visual map of IBI values equates to one breath (these visually appear as "spikes," similar to mountain-like peaks). Since each "spike" in the map represents one breath, by measuring the number of times this pattern occurs each minute throughout the night, your average respiratory rate can be determined. Interpret Your Respiratory Rate An average respiratory rate for healthy adults is 12–20 breaths per minute. The number is highly individual. Changes in your average respiratory rate tend to be quite small from night to night (within 1–2 breaths per minute). This is because the amount of oxygen you need at rest is likely to remain constant, making respiratory rate a very stable metric. A deviation of more than two breaths per minute from the average may not indicate anything alarming per se. If one's respiratory rate is significantly different from the normal number, especially if it stays that way for several nights, something may be straining their body. It’s essential to note that respiratory rate is individual to you, meaning you should only compare changes relative to your own baseline and not with other people’s data. Knowing your average respiratory rate, as well as your typical fluctuations within Oura, can help you stay attuned to when a change is outside your normal values. If your respiration rate is elevated from your baseline, it may be a sign that your body is under strain. Consider these as potential causes for a rise in respiratory rate: Fighting Off Illness : Respiratory rate is likely to increase with elevations in resting heart rate and decreases in heart rate variability when you’re falling ill. In the case that you're battling off a respiratory tract infection (e.g., bronchitis), increases in respiratory rate have to do with short-term damage done inside the lungs. Because these types of infections often impact the cells where gas exchange occurs between the air and your lungs, the oxygen and CO2 exchange process will naturally become less efficient under these circumstances. This leads to an elevated respiratory rate to make up for the difference. Air Quality or Altitude : Lower air quality will likely require your body to work harder to deliver the same amount of oxygen to your system that’s necessary for survival. This is because each breath is not gathering the same amount of oxygen it normally would in an environment with higher air quality, resulting in more breaths per minute to sustain your system. Similarly, because the oxygen content of air at higher altitudes is lower, your respiratory rate will naturally rise as you go up in elevation since your body is gathering less oxygen per breath. Long-Term Breathing Issues : Heavy snoring, coughing, and excess movement can interfere with the steady rise and fall of interbeat intervals that are used to estimate respiratory rate. This can lead to occasional variation in your data, especially if any of the listed circumstances above apply to you on a more frequent basis. Vigorous Exercise : Intense exercise concentrated on muscular endurance or anaerobic fitness (e.g., HIIT training), can cause respiration rate to remain elevated for roughly 20-40 minutes following workout completion. You may want to keep this in mind, especially when considering doing a challenging workout later in the day prior to bed. Anxiety : Rapid and irregular breathing patterns are associated with increased anxiety. Hormonal Changes: Women tend to have more variation in their respiratory rates, as changes in respiratory rate correlate with stages of the menstrual cycle . Respiration is slower at the beginning of the cycle (follicular phase) and speeds up towards the end (luteal phase). Room Temperature While Sleeping : If you’re sleeping in a bedroom that causes you to become hot or cold during the night, you may see changes in your respiratory rate as your body works harder to compensate for these temperature extremes. You’re likely to see slight elevations in your respiratory rate under either condition. The Accuracy of Oura's Respiratory Rate In an analysis conducted on behalf of our Data Science Team that compared Oura's photoplethysmography (PPG)-derived respiratory rate metric to an electrocardiogram (ECG)-derived method, the Oura Ring was shown to be accurate within 1 breath per minute across the entire night. An electrocardiogram is a test completed in a medical setting that measures the electrical activity of your heart. Because respiration is difficult to measure without invasive tools, ECG-derived respiratory rate is a well-established practice that’s been commonly used and identified as highly reliable in medical-grade research settings The results of the study held true across a full range of respiratory rates, from high (>20) to low (<14), observed in the pool of 43 healthy, young adults— classifying the Oura Ring as a valid tool for measuring average nighttime respiratory rate, on par with the ECG-derived method.

What Is Heart Rate Variability? How Oura Measures HRV Interpreting Long-Term HRV Interpreting Short-Term HRV The Importance of HRV When Does Oura Measure Heart Rate Variability? More Information What Is Heart Rate Variability? Heart rate variability (HRV) measures the variation in time (milliseconds) between your heartbeats. HRV provides a snapshot into how your body is balancing between the two branches of your autonomic nervous system: your sympathetic ("fight-or-flight") and parasympathetic ("rest-and-digest"). HRV indicates how well the body is responding to physiological stress, managing recovery, and maintaining overall health. Normal HRV can range anywhere from below 20 to over 200 milliseconds , depending on various factors such as age, sex, physical fitness, and genetics. The HRV value provided by Oura falls within this same range. HRV is a highly individual measure and you should compare your own HRV only with your own trends. As a general rule: High HRV (relative to your baseline) is associated with activation of your "rest-and-digest" branch, general physical fitness, and good recovery. Higher average nighttime HRV measurements have also been linked to better sleep quality and vice-versa. Low HRV (relative to your baseline) is associated with activation of your "fight-or-flight" branch, stress (both good and bad), illness, and overtraining. How Oura Measures HRV Oura calculates your nighttime HRV using the root mean square of the successive differences (rMSSD), a well-known HRV parameter that provides a reliable and accurate view of your autonomic nervous system’s activity. The average HRV you see is the mean of all five-minute samples taken while you sleep. Oura accounts for changes in your HRV every five minutes throughout the night, instead of just once at a single point during the night. This continuous tracking offers greater accuracy and gives you a more detailed view of how your body is responding to stress from the previous day—and how well it's preparing for the day ahead. Oura provides you with the following heart rate variability metrics: Average HRV : Your average HRV captured over the entire night Max HRV : Your highest HRV value captured over the entire night You can find HRV under readiness, sleep, or Trends . Tracking your HRV in the Trends view can help you see how well you've recovered over the past week and whether you should pay closer attention to any internal or external stressors. Interpreting Long-Term HRV HRV can't reduce stress or improve your cardiovascular fitness on its own, but it can offer insight into how your behavior, environment, and emotions are impacting your body. Measuring your HRV can be a great starting point for a healthier lifestyle—whether it's helping you manage stress better, adding more physical activity into your routine, or understanding how your diet affects your body's stress response. Check out " What is HRV Balance " on The Pulse Blog for more information. Interpreting Short-Term HRV 1. Interpret Your HRV Higher HRV values tend to occur during REM sleep. Lower HRV values tend to occur during deep sleep. 2. Interpret Your HRV Values (High & Low) HRV levels that are high or slightly higher than your normal range tend to be signs of good recovery. A higher HRV may be the result of: A much-needed rest day A cool bedroom at night Participation in more mindful, low-to-moderate-intensity activities like hiking or yoga Engagement in mindfulness meditation HRV levels that are lower than your normal range are signs of excessive strain on the body. Lower HRV may be the result of: Dehydration Consumption of alcohol A late night meal or workout Illness Acute and prolonged stress A hot bedroom at night Jet lag and inconsistent sleep patterns Overtraining Note: naturally, after a hard workout, your HRV will likely decline. As you recover, your HRV should rebound. If it doesn't return to your baseline or takes an extended period of time to, this can be an indication that you're training too often or too hard. A significantly higher HRV may indicate readiness for physical challenges or under-stimulation of the autonomic nervous system, whereas a significantly lower HRV might suggest excessive strain or poor recovery, potentially due to factors like stress, illness or other strain, dehydration, or overtraining. There is variation in HRV at different stages of the menstrual cycle. The Importance of HRV HRV reflects how the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of your autonomic nervous system work together. When both of these branches send signals to your heart, your heart rate naturally increases and decreases, resulting in variations between beats. Heart rate and HRV tend to be inversely connected. When your heart rate is slower, there's more time for variation between beats, leading to a higher HRV. On the other hand, a faster heart rate leaves less room for variation, usually resulting in a lower HRV. Having variation between your heartbeats is a sign that your autonomic nervous system is balanced and capable of responding to different stimuli in a healthy way. When Does Oura Measure Heart Rate Variability? Oura measures HRV during sleep to avoid the daytime "noise" that can affect your data and make it harder to interpret. Heart rate and HRV are sensitive metrics that can easily change from simple activities like drinking water, getting up to use the bathroom, or watching an exciting TV show. For Gen2 users: Certain unguided sessions will provide heart rate, HRV, and skin temperature snapshots upon completion. These sessions can be used at any time of the day. For Gen3 and Oura Ring 4 members: Explore contains meditation sessions and stories, some of which will also measure your heart rate, HRV, and skin temperature.

Use the Oura App to monitor fluctuations and trends in your average body temperature, and learn what these readings mean for your body's status and readiness. What Is Body Temperature? How to Use Body Temperature Trends More Information What Is Body Temperature? Within the Oura App, body temperature is the measure of changes in your average nighttime temperature , as compared to your normal baseline temperature. Oura calculates your normal temperature during the first couple of weeks that you wear your Oura Ring, and adjusts your baseline as needed. If your average body temperature goes outside your normal range (above or below 0.0) the Body temperature Readiness contributor will show "Pay attention." Significant deviation from your baseline temperature can be an indication of a change in your system, such as coming down with an illness or experiencing a change in your menstrual cycle. During the day, your average body temperature is impacted by eating, drinking, exercising, and other external factors. This is why Oura measures your average body temperature during sleep while your body is in its most stable state and when the temperature data is subject to a minimal amount of environmental "noise." These measurement methods enable Oura to provide you with the most accurate readings. In a study conducted by Oura's Science team , results revealed that Oura's temperature sensor matches research-grade performance under lab conditions, remains precise in real-world conditions, and reflects changes in your physiology, not your environment. It’s important to note that Oura measures average body temperature from the skin , which is not the same as basal, or core body temperature. Read more about why Oura measures temperature from your finger on our blog. How to Use Body Temperature Trends You can access your average body temperature trends by selecting "Readiness" from the Oura App's home screen or Vitals tab, then select "Body temperature" above your Readiness Score. You can also find body temperature in Trends : Select the menu in the upper-left of the app's home screen Select Trends Select Readiness Select Body temperature Body Temperature Graph Oura displays changes in your skin temperature as fluctuations (+/-) from your personal baseline. The closer the reading is to 0.0, the closer your current skin temperature is to your long-term average. The Daily view of the Body temperature graph displays the same value you see in your Readiness detail view—this value is the average of your skin temperature readings taken throughout the previous night. Each date in the Trend view displays a weighted average of how your body temperature varies from your baseline based on a three-day window. Days closer to the current date will have more of an impact on your readings. Temperature can be used to identify strain and recovery during physical activity, emerging illness, and phases of the menstrual cycle. For members who track their menstrual cycle, average body temperature is an integral part of Oura's Cycle Insights feature. The average body temperature metric is slightly different from other metrics found in the Oura App because it only contributes to your scores when average body temperature is abnormal. This means body temperature can only lower your Readiness Score, not boost it . If you notice changes in temperature that are lower than your average, this is likely due to changes in your internal regulatory system, which can be due to low peripheral blood flow, being exposed to cool environmental temperatures, or being in the follicular phase of one's menstrual cycle.

Learn what affects your score and how you can work toward better sleep. How Oura Measures Your Sleep Score What Is a Good Sleep Score? What Is the Crown Icon? How to Improve Your Sleep Score More Information How Oura Measures Your Sleep Score Oura analyzes your sleep by measuring the dynamics of your resting heart rate, average body temperature, movement, and time spent in specific sleep stages, including light, deep, and rapid eye movement (REM). Oura’s proprietary algorithms combine these metrics to provide a complete picture of your unique sleep patterns. Your Sleep Score gives you a holistic perspective of how well you're sleeping on a daily basis (overall sleep quality). It's calculated using multiple contributors , including your total sleep time, sleep efficiency (the percentage of time you spend asleep during the night), latency (the time it takes you to fall asleep), and more. You can view a detailed view of your Sleep Score by tapping on the sleep shortcut at the top of the Today tab, or going to the Vitals tab . What Is a Good Sleep Score? Readiness, Activity, and Sleep Scores — and their contributors — are rated on a scale of 0-100. 85-100: Optimal 70-84: Good 60-69: Fair 0-59: Pay Attention An 85 or higher may be a sign that you are ready to take on new challenges. Scores below 70 indicate that you may benefit from prioritizing rest and recovery in the indicated areas. What Is the Crown Icon? On days when your Readiness, Sleep, or Activity Score is 85 or higher, you'll see a crown icon next to your Readiness, Sleep, or Activity Scores. How to Improve Your Sleep Score Your body knows what it needs and will give you signs to help you find balance. Your Sleep Score is a reminder of those needs. If your score falls below 70, it might be a good time to focus on gradually working toward the 85 range. Below are some tips to help improve your Sleep Score. You can also add a tag for several of the options listed and observe how your sleep data may change via trends . Set aside enough time for sleep. To get the recommended 7-9 hours of total sleep per night, try to give yourself an 8-10 hour window between bedtime and wake-up. This buffer will account for the time it takes you to fall asleep, awake time, and any brief disturbances during the night—all of which don't count toward your total sleep time. Total sleep time is the most signficant contributor in achieving optimal rest and boosting your Sleep Score. Cut off screen time and artificial light at least an hour before bed . Dimming or turning off the primary lights in your home or bedroom can help, too. If you need to use a device near bedtime, dim the screen or consider blue light glasses to reduce stimulation. In the morning, try to get some natural light as soon as possible. Both reducing bright light at night and getting light in the morning help support your circadian rhythm, which regulates your sleep and wake patterns. Keep a consistent sleep schedule. Try to go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. Regularity helps anchor your sleep, which can naturally improve both its quantity and quality. Your circadian rhythm functions best with a consistent routine, making it easier for your body to rest and recharge. Limit strenuous exercise, heavy meals, and alcohol consumption ~3 hours before bed. Consuming foods high in sugar and low in fiber in the evening can lead to more wake-ups during the night and less deep sleep. This is because sugar raises your metabolic rate and average body temperature, making it harder for your body to relax and stay in a restful state. Limit caffeine past 2pm. Even some decaffeinated beverages, like decaf coffee or decaf green tea, still contain small traces of caffeine. You may want to consider limiting your consumption of these in the later evening hours as well. Create a relaxing nightime routine. Try activities like a warm shower, reading, light yoga, or mindfulness to help you unwind before bed. This can signal to your body and mind that it’s time to "power down," making it easier to fall asleep when you hit the pillow. Set aside time to clear your mind. Spend a few minutes in the two hours before bedtime to write down your thoughts, concerns, or to-do lists for the next day. Cool down your sleep environment. The optimal sleep temperature is around 67°F/18°C. Your body needs to slightly drop its core temperature by around 2-3°F/1°C to initiate sleep and keep you at rest throughout the night. A warm bath or shower in the hour or two before bed can help by drawing heat to the surface of your skin, allowing your body to cool down faster. Try to use your bed only for sleep and rest. Avoid activities like watching TV, working, or eating in bed. Doing these in your sleep space can create associations that make it harder to fall asleep and stay asleep.

With the Oura App, you can track the quantity and quality of your sleep, note your high points, and identify areas for improvement. What Are Sleep Stages? How Sleep Stages Are Measured Oura's Sleep Staging Algorithm More Information What Are Sleep Stages? In the Sleep detail view, you'll find color-coded sleep stage data at the top of the screen. Your sleep stage hypnogram is also available under the Details section. The Oura Ring measures four separate stages of sleep: Awake: the time you spent in bed before and after falling asleep. This also includes brief awakenings that occur during sleep REM: rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep involves increased brain activity and is often associated with vivid dreaming Light: light sleep guides you into deeper stages, and acts as the beginning of or transition between each sleep cycle Deep: also known as slow-wave sleep, deep sleep is when your body repairs and restores itself Every individual's sleep requirements are different, though the recommended amount is 7-9 hours for most adults. This is enough time for your body to go through four to five 90-minute sleep cycles. In general, you spend most of the night in light sleep. Here are some general tips: Try to optimize for less awake time and more restorative deep or REM sleep. If you're getting more REM sleep than usual, this may be a sign you’re recovering from prolonged sleep deprivation. Check out our blog for tips on getting more REM sleep . If you're getting more deep sleep than normal, it could be due to a recent hard workout or changes to improve your sleep quality. See this blog article for more ways to increase deep sleep . Remember, light sleep isn't "wasted sleep." Half of your total sleep time is usually made up of light sleep, which is a natural and healthy part of the sleep cycle. Learn more about light sleep and its benefits on the Pulse Blog. How Sleep Stages Are Measured Oura uses data from many of your biosignals — including movement, skin temperature, resting heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), and respiratory rate — to determine which sleep stage your body is in. Here are some of the indicators that Oura looks for at each stage: Light sleep: Respiratory rate slows Heart rate decreases Average body temperature drops Deep sleep: Low movement Heart rate and respiration stabilize Skin temperature is at its highest REM sleep: Respiratory rate increases Heart rate increases Learn more about how Oura measures sleep in this video: Oura's Sleep Staging Algorithm Oura's sleep staging algorithm achieved 79% agreement with polysomnography (PSG) sleep lab tests .

Sleep Contributors – Oura Help Why Oura How It Works For Business Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Accessibility Why Oura How It Works For Business My Requests Shop Oura Help Oura App App Features Sleep Articles in this section Sleep Score Sleep Stages Sleep Contributors Body Clock and Chronotype Bedtime Guidance Sleep Graphs Nap Detection Blood Oxygen Sensing (SpO2) Edit Bedtime and Wake-Up Time Sleep Contributors Your Sleep Score consists of seven key contributors that offer a holistic view of your overall sleep quality. For Sleep Insights, your personal data is compared to general recommendations from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), except for your ideal bedtime, which is personalized for you. Total Sleep Efficiency Restfulness REM Sleep Deep Sleep Latency Timing Bedtime Guidance Sleep Score and Contributor Ratings More Information Total Sleep Total sleep reflects the amount of time spent in light, REM, and deep sleep. All your sleep is taken into account, including naps. Most adults need 7–9 hours of sleep to perform well and stay healthy, but the amount needed varies from person to person. As a general rule, the younger you are, the more sleep you need. Sleep Efficiency Sleep efficiency reflects the percentage of time spent asleep compared to the time spent awake while in bed. It takes into account all sleep, including naps. For most adults, sleep efficiency of 85% is a sign of peaceful and uninterrupted sleep. Your Sleep Score may lowered if it takes more than 20 minutes to fall asleep or if you experience one long or several shorter wake-ups during your sleep. It's common for sleep efficiency to decrease slightly with age. Restfulness Restfulness tracks your wake-ups, excessive movement, and how often you get out of bed during sleep. It takes into account all your sleep, including naps. Everyone moves and wakes up during sleep, but too much tossing and turning can impact your sleep quality. You can see your movement during sleep under your sleep stage graph. Restless sleep is less restorative than uninterrupted sleep, and it can lead to daytime sleepiness. Common causes of disruptions include stress, noise, bed partners, pets, or certain foods. To improve your chances of getting restful sleep: Optimize your sleep environment by ensuring your mattress is comfortable, and your bedroom is quiet, dark, and cool (65°F/18°C) Avoid spicy or heavy meals and alcohol close to bedtime, and caffeine in the afternoon and evening Try to finish intense exercise at least 1–2 hours before bedtime Help your mind and body wind down by avoiding bright and blue lights 1-2 hours before going to sleep REM Sleep REM (rapid eye movement) sleep is associated with dreaming, memory consolidation, and creativity. It plays an important role in re-energizing both your mind and body, and includes all your sleep, including naps. This stage of sleep can make up anywhere from 5%–50% of your total sleep time. For most healthy adults, around 1.5 hours is considered optimal, though this may decrease slightly with age. REM sleep is regulated by your circadian rhythm (your body clock) and typically increases during the latter half of your sleep. Getting a full night's rest, maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, and avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and other stimulants in the evening can help you get more REM sleep. Deep Sleep Deep sleep is the most restorative and rejuvenating sleep stage. It includes all your sleep, including naps. Deep sleep can make up anywhere from 0%–35% of your total sleep. On average, adults spend 15%–20% (1–1.5 hours) of their total sleep time in deep sleep, though this percentage usually decreases with age. During deep sleep, your blood pressure drops, heart and breathing rates become steady, arm and leg muscles relax, and it's harder for you to wake up. This stage is essential for muscle growth and repair, refreshing your immune system, and helping the brain clear out toxins. You typically get more deep sleep earlier in the night. To increase your deep sleep, keep a consistent sleep schedule and avoid heavy meals, stimulants, and bright screens 1–2 hours before bed. Long naps and caffeine in the late afternoon or evening can reduce deep sleep, while regular exercise can help increase it. Sleep Latency Definition & Measurement Sleep latency measures how long it takes you to fall asleep at night. It’s only tracked for your longest sleep period. Ideally, it should take you 15 to 20 minutes to fall asleep. Falling asleep in less than five minutes may be a sign of overtiredness. If you have trouble falling asleep, try something relaxing in low light until you feel sleepy again. For some, it helps to get out of bed, but avoid activities that might energize you. Timing Sleep timing plays an important role in your overall sleep quality and daytime performance. Ideally, your sleep should align with your 24-hour natural rhythm, also known as your circadian rhythm. The Timing contributor takes into account all your sleep, including naps. Optimally, the midpoint of your sleep should fall between midnight and 3am, though this can vary depending on whether you're a morning or evening type. If you feel tired during the day, the best time to nap is usually in the early afternoon. Most of your body’s essential processes—like average body temperature, sleep, hormones, hunger, and digestion—are regulated by a 24-hour cycle. Sleeping at night and staying active during the day helps keep your internal rhythms in balance. This can help you perform better throughout the day. Sleep Score and Contributor Ratings Readiness, Activity, and Sleep Scores — and their contributors — are rated on a scale of 0-100. 85-100: Optimal 70-84: Good 60-69: Fair 0-59: Pay Attention An 85 or higher may be a sign that you are ready to take on new challenges. Scores below 70 indicate that you may benefit from prioritizing rest and recovery in the indicated areas.

You can use these to establish healthier sleeping habits, or to gain an understanding of when your mind and body are at their peak and low points of the day. Body Clock and chronotype are available for: Gen2 Gen3 and Oura Ring 4 with active membership iOS Android What Is the Body Clock? What Is the Chronotype? How to Use the Body Clock How to Use the Chronotype Things to Keep in Mind More Information What Is the Body Clock? The Body Clock graph displays a 24-hour clock face with color-coded sections to compare your optimal sleep window to your current sleep patterns. Your optimal sleep window is based on your chronotype — the biological baseline or circadian rhythm that determines when you are at your most active and alert. How is Body Clock different from Bedtime Guidance? Bedtime guidance is based on your past wake-up times: The Oura App takes your recent wake-up times and, based on your best Sleep Scores, sets a recommended bedtime intended to help you get an optimal amount of sleep before your projected next wake-up time. The easiest way to think of these two features is that your Body Clock and chronotype are aspirational guidelines for your ideal sleep times based on your circadian rhythm. Bedtime guidance is a suggested bedtime to get the most amount of sleep available based on your recent sleep patterns. What Is the Chronotype? "Chronotype" is another way of saying if you're a morning person, a night person, or somewhere in between. Oura divides chronotypes into six types: Early morning type Morning type Late morning type Early evening type Evening type Late evening type How the chronotype is calculated Oura takes your data from the past 90 days and looks for at least 30 periods of long sleep (more than three hours). The app uses activity, average body temperature, and sleep patterns from this time period to estimate your chronotype. It can take anywhere from 40–90 days before you may see your chronotype in the app. Naps are not included in your chronotype calculation. How to Use the Body Clock Your Body Clock card will tell you how closely your sleep rhythm's midpoint from the night before was aligned to the midpoint of an optimal sleep window, as determined by your chronotype. If necessary, the Body Clock will provide guidance on how much to adjust your sleep timing in order to align with your circadian rhythm. Tap the Body Clock card to open a more detailed version: The outer ring of the clockface indicates your sleep schedule from the night before. The inner ring is your optimal sleep schedule based on your chronotype. You can use the Body Clock to see at a glance how closely the two schedules are aligned. Tap the info ⓘ icon in the upper-right corner of the app for more information on circadian rhythms. Tap the chronotype description at the bottom of the Body Clock screen for more information on your specific chronotype. How to Use the Chronotype You can find your chronotype by tapping on the Body Clock card in the Today tab of your Oura App. The chronotype is displayed at the bottom of the Body Clock screen. You can also find your chronotype in the My Health tab. Tap into it to learn more information about your specific chronotype, as well as educational information about how you can capitalize on your sleep patterns. Morning types benefit from waking up early and undertaking physical or mental tasks during the first half of the day. Evening types prefer to sleep in, and feel more alert and creative during the late hours of the day. Read more at the Pulse Blog: What Is Your Chronotype & Why Does It Matter? Things to Keep in Mind The following conditions must be met for Body Clock and chronotype data to appear: The Oura App requires data from at least 30 long sleep periods (at least three hours) within the past 90 days, and at least 30 days of physical activity and temperature data in order to calculate your chronotype The ring should be worn properly (a tight enough fit, with sensors on the palm side of your finger) to ensure complete data gathering Travel to a time zone more than one hour in difference will interfere with data collection Ensure that your ring and the Oura App have synced at least once a week The ring must be worn consistently during the day and night because daytime readings also contribute to chronotype calculation Frequently removing your ring for extended periods of time can interfere with data collection More Information Bedtime Guidance Edit Bedtime and Wake-Up Time Body Temperature Circadian Rhythms and Your Bedtime What is Your Chronotype?

What is Bedtime Guidance? How to Use Bedtime Guidance Troubleshooting More Information What is Bedtime Guidance? Oura’s Bedtime Guidance analyzes your highest Sleep Scores and lowest resting heart rates to determine which sleep patterns work best for you. Using your typical wake-up times and the recommended amount of sleep, the Oura App will notify you when your optimal bedtime is approaching. Remember, Bedtime Guidance is just a recommendation, and missing the suggested window won’t directly impact your Sleep or Readiness Scores. Bedtime Guidance is also different from the Body Clock , which offers sleep schedule recommendations based on your chronotype. While the Body Clock provides ideal sleep times based on your circadian rhythm, Bedtime Guidance suggests when to go to sleep to maximize rest based on your recent sleep patterns. How to Use Bedtime Guidance The Bedtime Guidance card will display at the top of your Today tab an hour before the recommended bedtime window. For the rest of the day, it can be found in a collapsed form farther down on the tab. Tap on Bedtime Guidance to see more details, including your upcoming optimal bedtime window, your previous night's bedtime, and a graph of sleep times from the past several weeks. Note that bedtime recommendations are automatically determined and can't be manually edited. For more insights, you can view your bedtime trends by day, week, month, or year in the app's Trends : Tap the menu in the upper-left corner of the Today tab Select Trends Select Sleep > Bedtime We also recommend turning on Bedtime notifications to be alerted when your ideal sleep window approaches: Tap the menu in the upper-left corner of the Today tab Select Settings Select Notifications Toggle Bedtime notifications on Troubleshooting The Bedtime Guidance card appears only on the current day of the Oura App. Bedtime Guidance requires two weeks of consistent data before it can show recommendations and insights. An irregular sleep schedule or consistently low Sleep Scores can also affect Oura's ability to provide Bedtime Guidance. If you do not see a Bedtime Guidance card, continue wearing your ring and try to follow a more regular sleep schedule over the next week or two.

How to Use the Hypnogram How to Use the Nighttime Movement Graph How to Use the Body Clock How to Use the Sleep Timing Graph How to Use the Hypnogram Widget Things to Keep in Mind More Information How to Use the Hypnogram A hypnogram is a graph of sleep cycles throughout the night. Your hypnogram can be found below the sleep contributors under Details in the Sleep detail view. The number above the hypnogram is your "Time asleep." This is not the same as your total time in bed, which may include periods of awake time. For adults, it is recommended to get at least seven hours of sleep each night. Sleep cycles typically consist of ~90 minute groupings, each containing some amount of light, deep, and REM sleep. Sleep varies from person to person, so a sleep cycle may not always have all three stages, and may not always last 90 minutes. The average amount of time spent in each sleep stage is: Awake: 2-5% Light: 45-55% Deep: 13-23% REM: 20-25% If you export your sleep stage data from the Oura App to Apple Health , your sleep stages graph may appear differently. The Oura App hypnogram displays sleep data using five-minute intervals, optimizing for readability while still accurately reflecting sleep stage trends. Apple may apply slight rounding or display sleep graphs using different time intervals, which can result in variations between the two views. How to Use the Nighttime Movement Graph The nighttime movement graph is located directly beneath your hypnogram. Vertical lines on the graph each represent five-minute increments and correlate with movement in your sleep—the more movement, the taller the line. Short lines can indicate tossing and turning or general restlessness. Tall lines may correlate to times when you were awake. Compare your nighttime movement graph to the hypnogram to see which sleep stage was associated with the amount of motion. Very low movement typically correlates to long periods of deep or REM sleep, a good sign of high-quality rest. Learn more about nighttime movement on our blog. How to Use the Body Clock Your Body Clock card will tell you how closely your sleep rhythm's midpoint from the night before was aligned to the midpoint of an optimal sleep window, as determined by your chronotype. If necessary, the Body Clock will provide guidance on how much to adjust your sleep timing in order to align with your circadian rhythm. Tap the Body Clock card to open a more detailed version: The outer ring of the clockface indicates your sleep schedule from the night before. The inner ring is your optimal sleep schedule based on your chronotype. You can use the Body Clock to see at a glance how closely the two schedules are aligned. Tap the info ⓘ icon in the upper-right corner of the app for more information on circadian rhythms. Tap the chronotype description at the bottom of the Body Clock screen for more information on your specific chronotype. How to Use the Sleep Timing Graph Sleep regularity is a Readiness Score contributor that measures how consistent your bedtime and wake-up times have been. In the My Health tab or the Trends section of your Oura App, you can find data visualizations of your sleep regularity patterns by day, week, month, or year. Below the sleep regularity trend chart is a graph of your sleep timing, which shows your time in bed , time asleep , and any awake time interruptions during the night. The sleep timing chart represents the consistency of your sleep as vertical bars. The time you went to bed is at the top of the graph, with wake time at the bottom. Time in bed is visualized with a faint, dark blue bar. Time asleep is visualized with a solid, bright blue bar. Any interruptions to your sleep during the night appear as gaps in the bar. Scroll left and right to see more data. The y-axis of the chart is fixed to your median sleep time plus two hours. Any data outside that time, such as a very early bed time or very late wake up time, cuts off at the upper or lower edges of the graph. Weekly, monthly, and yearly views of your sleep regularity trends display averages of your sleep timing for those time periods. How to Use the Hypnogram Widget There are three available iOS widgets (small, medium, and large) available to display the most recent night of data on your device's home screen. These are available to Oura members using iOS devices and any generation Oura Ring. The widgets display: Small: sleep stages Medium: sleep stages and sleep/wake time Large: sleep stages, sleep/wake time, and ring battery status To install a sleep graph widget : Touch and hold your device's home screen Tap the Add (+) button Select a widget and widget size Tap Done Things to Keep in Mind The Oura Ring is not a medical device and is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, monitor, or prevent medical conditions or illnesses.

How Nap Detection Works Things to Keep in Mind More Information What is Nap Detection? With Nap Detection, Oura users get credit for all accumulated sleep throughout the day and night. For those who regularly nap, or sleep more during the day due to shift-work, polyphasic sleep patterns, new parenthood, etc., Nap Detection will improve sleep tracking accuracy, and account for these sleep periods in Sleep and Readiness Scores. If your nap is recorded after 6pm, your Sleep and Readiness Scores won't be updated until the following morning. However, you'll still be able to see all sleep analysis data from your nap (i.e. sleep stages, RHR, HRV, etc). Once your scores update, they'll also be reflected in on the Sleep and Readiness screens, as well as in your trends graphs. How Nap Detection Works For Oura to detect sleep as a nap, it must be between 15 minutes and three hours in length, and your body must fall into at least one sleep stage (e.g. light, deep, or REM) during that time. It is possible that your time in bed may extend beyond 15 minutes, but changes in your heart rate, movement, and average body temperature do not yet indicate that you've physically entered sleep. Extra movement or an elevated heart rate may also delay detection of a nap. In these cases, a presumed nap may be instead labeled as a rest and shown on the 24-hour heart rate graph as restorative time (green). Any sleep picked up by Oura that's longer than three hours will be viewed as your longest sleep period, and added automatically. Please note: In many cases, the Oura App won't detect a nap if it occurs within four hours of the end of the main sleep cycle. To increase the likelihood of additional sleep being included in your main sleep cycle, we recommend syncing your Oura Ring or placing it on the charger only after your second wake-up time (if your nap is within four hours of your first wake-up time). If a nap at least 15 minutes long is detected, it will be added to the timeline on the Oura App's Today screen and to the Sleep screen. By tapping on the nap, you'll see full sleep analysis of your nap, including your hypnogram, amount of time spent in each stage, as well as your movement, resting heart rate, and heart rate variability graphs. If the nap is inaccurately recorded, you can delete it through this screen to remove its impact on your Sleep and Readiness Scores. Your nap details will be shown in the app's home, Sleep, and Readiness screens. Things to Keep in Mind The only Sleep and Readiness contributors not impacted by naps are Latency (included in your Sleep Score ), Recovery Index, Activity, and Activity Balance (included in your Readiness Score ) Your Sleep Score may be impacted (positively or negatively) depending on the quality of rest and timing of your nap Your Readiness Score may also be lowered if your average body temperature significantly elevates while you nap, as this can be a sign of emerging illness Nap Detection data is currently not available via Oura on the Web Naps cannot be manually adjusted More Information Sleep Stages Sleep Contributors Readiness Contributors How Does the Oura Ring Track My Sleep?

These measurements show how efficiently your body circulates and absorbs oxygen, making it a useful index of your overall health, as well as indicating possible disturbances in your breathing during the night. Blood Oxygen Sensing is available for: Gen3 and Oura Ring 4 with active membership iOS Android This feature is not available on Gen2 or older. How Does Blood Oxygen Sensing Work? How to Use the Blood Oxygen Sensing Features Blood Oxygen Sensing Troubleshooting Things to Keep in Mind More Information How Does Blood Oxygen Sensing (SpO2) Work? The Oura Ring measures peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels in your blood by sending light from the ring's red and infrared LEDS into your finger while you sleep, and then measuring how much light is reflected. Richly oxygenated blood reflects more red light than infrared light, while poorly oxygenated blood reflects more infrared light than red light. Your blood oxygen measurements are located on the Oura App's Sleep screen. The Average Blood Oxygen reading is the percentage of your blood that contains oxygen. The Breathing Regularity graph displays variations in how much oxygen is present in your blood. This is different from respiratory rate , which measures how many breaths per minute (BPM) you take. Average Blood Oxygen and Breathing Regularity are measured during sleep periods longer than three hours , but the Oura App only displays the results for the longest sleep period of the day . Please note that you may see the red LEDs light up whenever your Oura Ring detects that you may be asleep (based on your heart rate, movement, and respiratory rate), including during the day. How to Use the Blood Oxygen Sensing (SpO2) Features Average Blood Oxygen and Breathing Regularity are turned on by default. To toggle them on or off: Go to the menu in the upper left corner of the Oura App's home screen Select Blood Oxygen Sensing Select the toggle next to Blood Oxygen Sensing Note: Your ring must be connected to the app over Bluetooth in order to switch the feature on and off. After your next sleep period of more than three hours, check the Sleep screen. There you will find the Average Blood Oxygen percentage and Breathing Regularity display. Suspected variations in your blood oxygen levels are shown in a color-coded timeline, indicating sampling intervals of 15 minutes. Optimal: no significant variations to display Good: few variations detected (dark blue line) Fair: occasional variations detected (light blue line) Pay attention: frequent variations detected (white line) If your blood oxygen levels are measured as "Optimal" throughout the night, the Oura App will not display a Breathing Regularity timeline. Tap on the information ⓘ icon in the app to learn more about Breathing Regularity, how to improve it, and how to interpret the displayed information. Blood Oxygen Sensing (SpO2) Troubleshooting You might see Average Blood Oxygen values that are lower than expected for a variety of reasons, including: Sleeping in a position that constrains the amount of blood flow to your hand or arm Having the ring in the wrong orientation Having a too loose or tightly fitting ring Excessive movement during sleep If you are not seeing any blood oxygenation data after a sleep period of three hours or more, try the following: Ensure that you have the latest app software and ring firmware installed Charge your ring to at least 30% before going to bed Ensure that your ring fits snugly, and that the LED sensors are on the underside (palm-side) of your finger Make sure that your ring is not in Airplane Mode Turn on your device's Bluetooth to enable your ring to sync data with the Oura App Things to Keep in Mind High variation in overnight blood oxygen measurements can be a sign that something is challenging your health, such as illness, altitude, or breathing issues. The Oura Ring is not a medical device and is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, monitor, or prevent medical conditions or illnesses. Please do not make any changes to your medication, nutrition, or workouts without first consulting your doctor or another medical professional. The Blood Oxygen Sensing features use the red and infrared LEDs throughout the night, which impacts your ring's overall battery life. We recommend turning on low battery notifications as a reminder. Blood Oxygen Sensing features do not directly impact any your daily scores. However, if something is impacting the variations in Breathing Regularity and Average Blood Oxygen, it may show up in the Sleep and Readiness scores already.

How Oura Measures Your Activity Score What Is a Good Activity Score? What Is the Crown Icon? What is Walking Equivalency? How to Improve Your Activity Score More Information How Oura Measures Your Activity Score Your Activity Score is measured using your daily activity (how much you move throughout the day), step count, training frequency, and training volume, among other metrics. The Oura Ring captures these metrics using a 3D accelerometer, which registers all daily movement, including both step-based activities like walking and running, as well as non-step-based activities like light housework. What Is a Good Activity Score? Readiness, Activity, and Sleep Scores — and their contributors — are rated on a scale of 0-100. 85-100: Optimal 70-84: Good 60-69: Fair 0-59: Pay Attention An 85 or higher may be a sign that you are ready to take on new challenges. Scores below 70 indicate that you may benefit from prioritizing rest and recovery in the indicated areas. What Is the Crown Icon? On days when your Readiness, Sleep, or Activity Score is 85 or higher, you'll see a crown icon next to your Readiness, Sleep, or Activity Scores. What is Walking Equivalency? Walking equivalency shows your daily activity as a walking distance. The Oura Ring calculates daily activity as an aggregate of all movement throughout the day, which may include both step-based movement (for example, running) and non-step-based movement (e.g., light housework). The distance shown is not the actual mileage you’ve traveled, but the equivalent walking distance of all your daily activities. Walking equivalency answers the question, "How much would I have had to walk to burn the amount of calories that I did?” Higher-intensity activities like jogging increase your daily walking equivalency more than low-intensity activities such as casual walking, even if the actual distance traveled is the same. How to Improve Your Activity Score Oura promotes an active but balanced lifestyle. The focus is on staying physically active throughout the week. Aim for 2-3 sessions per week where your heart and breathing rates get into elevated zones that challenge your system, and try to avoid complete inactivity on a daily basis. Here are a few tips to consider when looking to achieve a higher Activity Score: Keep your total inactive time below 8 hours per day. This will positively affect your Activity Score. In contrast, being inactive for more than 10 hours daily will negatively impact your score Move for just a few minutes each hour (for example, standing up from your desk to stretch your legs). This can improve your score. You can enable inactivity alerts in your settings if you'd like to receive a friendly reminder to get your blood flowing after 50 consecutive minutes of inactivity Strive to meet your activity goal five or more times per week. Keep in mind that your activity goals are based on your readiness level Get your step count up. There is no step count goal as a feature of your Oura experience; rather, the focus is on comparing steps to your own baseline. Of course, some days will be more inactive than others, but if you can increase your average step count by bumping up your daily movement with 1,000 additional steps for example, you'll see boosts in your score and gains in your overall health Try to get in 2,000-3,000 calories of medium-to-high-intensity activity per week. For an average adult, this equates to two hours of jogging or 4.5 hours of brisk walking per week. If your volume falls to 750-1,500 calories per week, this will negatively impact your Activity Score The goal is to alternate between pushing yourself and allowing time to recover, which will help you build fitness in the long run. If you've gone five days without active rest, the "Recovery Time" contributor will detract from your overall Activity Score. Read more about Activity Contributors .

A high Stay Active contributor score means you've succeeded in moving consistently throughout the day. Keeping your inactive time to 5–8 hours or less of inactivity time positively impacts your Activity Score. You'll be asked to pay attention if your inactive time exceeds 12 hours per day. Move Every Hour This contributor shows how well you've managed to avoid long periods of sitting, standing, or otherwise being passive during the past 24 hours. Staying active and moving for 2–3 minutes regularly helps increase blood flow, support your body in functioning at an optimal level, and help you remain energized throughout the day. If you've enabled notifications, Oura will remind you to move after 50 minutes of inactivity. Meet Daily Goals Meet daily goals shows how often you’ve reached your daily activity goal over the past seven days. Activity goals determined based on your Readiness Score, age, height, weight, and sex assigned at birth. Reaching your daily goal 6–7 times a week is optimal. Missing your target on three or more days starts to lower your Activity Score. Training Frequency This contributor shows how often you’ve engaged in medium and high-intensity activities over the past seven days. Exercising 3–4 times a week helps you stay in balance and increase your Activity Score. Regular exercise is important for maintaining and developing your cardiovascular fitness. Oura recommends getting at least 100 Metabolic Equivalent (MET) minutes of medium to high-intensity level activities a day (100-150kcal, depending on your body weight). This is equivalent to 20 minutes of jogging or 30 minutes of brisk walking. MET is a common measure used to express the energy expenditure and intensity of physical activities. If the MET value of a specific activity is 4, it means that you're burning four times as many calories as you would burn while resting. Training Volume Training volume measures how much medium and high-intensity activity you've gotten over the past seven days. Like training frequency, your Training volume is important for maintaining and improving your fitness level. For the Training volume contributor to be at 100%, you need to get 2,000 MET minutes of medium to high-intensity level activities per week (2,000-3,000 kcal, depending on your body weight). If your activity level falls below 750 MET minutes a week (750–1,500 kcal), your Activity Score may start to decline. Recovery Time Recovery time tracks the number of rest days you've had during the week and when your last easy day occured. Regular exercise is important for fitness, but rest days are just as crucial. Your muscles repair and grow during these recovery periods. To support recovery, aim for 1–2 easy days each week, and try to avoid long gaps between them. Recovery time scores: Optimal: You've had enough easy days during the past week Good: You've had easy days during the past week, but try to have another one within the next couple of days Fair: You've had an easy day during the past week, but try to take another one today Pay attention: You haven't had an easy day recently. Try to have one as soon as possible The recommended activity levels for an easy day depend on factors such as age and sex assigned at birth. As an example, an easy day can include: A maximum of 15 minutes of high-intensity activity No more than 85 minutes of medium and high-intensity activity Less activity in equivalent kilometers/miles than your average Activity Score and Contributor Ratings Readiness, Activity, and Sleep Scores — and their contributors — are rated on a scale of 0-100. 85-100: Optimal 70-84: Good 60-69: Fair 0-59: Pay Attention An 85 or higher may be a sign that you are ready to take on new challenges. Scores below 70 indicate that you may benefit from prioritizing rest and recovery in the indicated areas. Things to Keep in Mind Your activity insights are based on general recommendations for regular exercise and daily movement. If you believe your activity data isn't being tracked accurately, you can improve accuracy by manually adding activities or importing your activities from third-party apps .

The app supports a wide range of activity types and allows you to add custom activities as well. What Is Manually Add an Activity? How to Manually Add an Activity More Information What Is Manually Add an Activity? Most activity recognized by your Oura Ring is automatically recorded within the app, and counts toward your Activity Score. Activity is one of the key components of calculating your Readiness Score through the "Previous day activity" and "Activity balance" contributors. Capturing all types of movements helps improve the Oura activity detection algorithm and provides better insight messages. However, the app does not automatically detect some unsupported activities, activities under ten minutes in duration, or activities you undertake while not wearing an Oura Ring (unless imported from a third-party app ). Manually adding an activity provides a way to fill in these gaps. How to Manually Add an Activity To manually add an activity: Tap the "+" button in the bottom-right corner of the Oura App Select "Add an activity" Choose an activity type Your three most recent activities will be displayed at the top. (If this is your first time manually adding an activity, these choices default to "Running," "Walking," and "Cycling") Select "More activities" for a searchable list of 50+ options If you don't see the desired option, select "Other" (at the bottom of the list) and enter an activity name for it Add "Start time," "Duration," and "Intensity" details Select "Done" in the upper-right corner to save your activity Confirmed activities appear on the home screen of the Oura App, and under "Activities" on the Activity screen Edit or Delete Activity To edit or delete an activity in the Oura App: Tap on the activity in the Timeline on the app's home screen or from the list of activities in the Activity screen Scroll down and select Edit activity at the bottom of the screen Edit the type of activity, and its time started, duration, or intensity , as needed Select Done to save changes Activities can also be deleted from the Edit activity screen. Deleting an activity will remove its impact on any of your scores and contributors. Activities can be added, edited, or deleted only on the current day .

Activity trackers that count calories are problematic for members who are recovering from eating disorders, or who want credit for activities such as breastfeeding, for example. The Oura App includes the ability for members to choose a daily step target instead of a daily calorie burn target, and to opt out of displayed calories entirely, so that activity features better fit your lifestyle. Editing activity goals is available on Oura Ring Gen2 and on all later generation rings with an active membership . How to Edit Activity Goal How Activity Goal Works Things to Keep in Mind More Information How to Edit Activity Goal Tap the Activity card in the home screen and then select "Edit activity goal" in the detail view Use the slider to choose a baseline activity goal. You can choose between two goal types: active calorie burn or steps. If you'd prefer not to see calories in the app, toggle on "Calorie opt out." This will hide all calorie-related information, and only steps will be shown in activity-related messaging throughout the app. How Activity Goal Works The value on the slider is your baseline goal calculated from the age, height, weight, and sex assigned at birth in your profile settings. Moving the slider will change the starting value from which Oura calculates your daily goals. Oura then automatically adjusts and displays your daily activity goal based on your Readiness Score. On days when your Readiness Score is above 85, the daily activity goal will be automatically adjusted to higher than the selected baseline goal. Daily activity goals are reduced to below the selected baseline goal on days when Readiness is below 70. Baseline and daily activity goals are equal to each other on days when Readiness is 70-84. You can learn more about how Oura measures steps and activity here , and more about your Activity Score on the Pulse blog . Things to Keep in Mind When toggled off, calories will not display anywhere in the app, including on imported activities, the post-workout screen, and the Meet Daily Goals contributor. All other activity features are not impacted Calorie numbers are only hidden starting from the day the toggle is selected.

What is Automatic Activity Detection? How to Use AAD Most Popular Activities Detectable by AAD More Information What is Automatic Activity Detection? AAD automatically reports all detected physical activity captured by your Oura Ring—suggesting the time, duration, type, and intensity of activities you take part in. With AAD, you have the option to edit or confirm each of the detected activities, ensuring the time, duration, type, and intensity are correct, or you can choose to dismiss activities altogether. A unique characteristic of AAD is that the more this feature gets to know you and your movement tendencies, the more personalized your insights become. The more activities you confirm over time, the more actionable guidance you'll receive from Oura. Because movement captured by AAD comes from your real-time physical experience, this feature offers a more accurate calculation of calories burned during an activity. As you continue to use AAD and confirm activities, your detected workouts and their details become more precise as your personal movement tendencies add up over time. No action on your part is required to start or stop tracking. Currently, over 40 unique activity types are detectable with AAD—a wider range than what's currently offered by other wearables. How to Use AAD There is no action required on your part to start or stop tracking activities with Automatic Activity Detection. By identifying unique patterns in your movement over short periods of time, Oura can identify particular activity types, such as cycling, soccer, tennis, or use of an elliptical machine. Note that activities shorter than 10 minutes will not be picked up by AAD. Due to the way Oura captures your daily movement and calculates exertion, AAD is accurate to within one minute. Any detected activities will appear in a card at the top of the Oura App's home screen — including the type, time, duration, calorie burn, and heart rate (if available). You have the option to edit or confirm each of the detected activities, ensuring the time, duration, type, and intensity are correct, or you can choose to dismiss them altogether. If confirmed (including after an edit is complete), the activity will be added to your full list of activities on the app's home screen. This same full list of activities is also located on your Activity screen. Tap on a confirmed activity to view more details, including route and distance (if applicable), heart rate, and heart rate zones. If you want to record route and distance details, make sure that location services are turned on before you begin your activity , and take your phone with you . Otherwise, you can leave your phone at home and the ring will still record your Activity Heart Rate. To conserve Oura Ring battery life, you can turn off heart rate tracking with AAD: Select the menu in the upper left of the Oura App's home screen Select Settings Select Activity Select the toggle next to Activity heart rate When the toggle is off, AAD information will still be shown in the app, but will not include heart rate information. For more information on Activity Heart Rate, see this help center article . If you already track your activities using another device, Oura can identify when the same activity has been detected and will present it only once to prevent double counting. Manually added activities take precedence, followed by activity imported via third-party devices , and then activity added through AAD. If you completed an activity and AAD couldn't detect it, you can add it manually using the + menu in the lower right of the app's home screen. All manual activity entries count towards your daily activity goal. AAD will continue to detect activities even while your Oura Ring is in Airplane Mode . However, your detected activities will not be visible in the Oura App until Airplane Mode is turned off and your data has been synced. If more than two calendar days have passed since you turned on Airplane Mode, only detected activities from the current and previous day will be shown. Edit or Delete Activity To edit or delete an activity in the Oura App: Tap on the activity in the Timeline on the app's home screen or from the list of activities in the Activity screen Scroll down and select Edit activity at the bottom of the screen Edit the type of activity, and its time started, duration, or intensity , as needed Select Done to save changes Activities can also be deleted from the Edit activity screen. Deleting an activity will remove its impact on any of your scores and contributors. Activities can be added, edited, or deleted only on the current day . If the activity was imported from a third-party app, it cannot be edited or deleted in the Oura App. An imported activity can be removed or edited only through the app it was recorded in (for example: Garmin or Apple Health). Most Popular Activities Detectable by AAD Here is a list of the most popular activities that can be automatically detected by the Oura Ring. Please note, this is not a comprehensive list of all activities Oura can pick up. If you're unsure if a certain activity you partake in is detectable by Oura, you can test it by wearing your ring while completing your activity and then checking the Oura App home screen for an AAD card.

Daily Movement Graph The daily movement graph (found in your Activity detail view) provides a snapshot of your activity levels throughout the day. It breaks your movement into different intensity levels—low, medium, high, and inactive—so you can easily see when you were most active and when you had periods of rest. Lo w activity includes casual walking and light housework. During low activity, your energy expenditure (calorie burn) is about 2–4 times higher than your resting level. While the health benefits of low-intensity activities aren't as well-defined as those of higher intensities, getting low activity helps speed up your activities and reduce inactive time. Medium activity includes dynamic activities with an intensity level equivalent to brisk walking. High activity includes vigorous activities with an intensity level higher or equivalent to jogging. Getting regular medium and high-intensity-level exercises has many fitness and health benefits, including better sleep quality, improved cardiovascular fitness, improved glucose metabolism, better mental health, and reduced risk of several diseases. Tips to Consider Move throughout the day: Try to avoid long periods of inactivity. Even small bursts of low-intensity movement can make a difference. Inactive time adds up throughout the day, and spending more than 10 hours inactive can lower your Activity Score Balance your activity levels: If you're able to, try to get a mix of low, medium, and high-intensity movement to support overall health Listen to your body : On recovery days or days when your Readiness Score is low, it's okay to take it easy.

What Is Activity Heart Rate? How to Use Activity Heart Rate Things to Keep in Mind More Information What Is Activity Heart Rate? The Activity Heart Rate features record heart rate readings while you exercise and — in combination with daytime heart rate measurements, Live Heart Rate , Daytime Stress , and nighttime Resting Heart Rate (RHR) — presents you with a complete, 24-hour heart rate graph . Upon completion of your activity, the Oura App will display detailed graphs of your activity heart rate and heart rate zones. On the daily heart rate graph, activity heart rate is displayed as an orange line. If you take your phone with you with location services enabled, the app will display a map and route of your completed activity (see Location Services for Activities for more information). What Are Heart Rate Zones? Heart rate zones are a measure of activity intensity. Oura uses six heart rate zones, and the ranges assigned to each zone are calculated using an age-based estimate of your max heart rate. Time spent in all six heart rate zones can have positive impacts on metabolic processes. Rigorous exercise is important, but even low-intensity activities and everyday movement can improve energy, weight management, and insulin sensitivity over time. Activities in higher heart rate zones have metabolic and cardiovascular benefits. You can learn more about heart rate zones on our blog . How to Use Activity Heart Rate If you want to record route and distance details, make sure that location services are turned on before you begin your activity , and take your phone with you . Otherwise, you can leave your phone at home and the ring will still record your Activity Heart Rate. Automatic Activity Detection + Heart Rate Activity Heart Rate works with Oura's Automatic Activity Detection (AAD) feature to record your heart rate during many activities, without any further action required on your part. An activity must last at least 10 minutes to be automatically detected, and your ring must have at least five percent battery. To conserve Oura Ring battery life, you can turn off heart rate tracking with AAD: Select the menu in the upper left of the Oura App's home screen Select Settings Select Activity Select the toggle next to Activity heart rate When the toggle is off, AAD information will still be shown in the app, but will not include heart rate information. After you have confirmed a detected activity on the app's home screen, you can tap on the activity to view more details. AAD captures most types of movement, but if you find that your particular activity is consistently not showing up in the Oura App, you can instead manually record your heart rate during an activity (see steps below), or you can manually add an activity after you've completed it. This will ensure that you receive credit for all of your daily movement. Manually Record HR Tap the + menu in the bottom right of the Oura App's home screen Select Record workout HR Select activity type Hit record to begin . You can pause and resume your activity recording at any time When you're finished, tap " Pause " and then " End activity " to stop recording heart rate Remember to stop your activity in the app when you’re done, otherwise the ring battery charge may be affected. You will receive a reminder notification if your activity has been running for more than three hours View activity details, including your heart rate zones and heart rate graph You can edit your activity the same way you would edit a manually added activity Your Activity Heart Rate readings will be color-coded orange in the daytime heart rate graph .

If the activity was imported from a third-party app, it cannot be edited or deleted in the Oura App. An imported activity can be removed or edited only through the app it was recorded in (for example: Garmin or Apple Health). Things to Keep in Mind Activity Heart Rate is not the same as passive daytime heart rate measurement. Activity Heart Rate uses a higher sampling rate to accurately record your pulse during exercise. Daytime heart rate measurement takes a reading of your pulse at lower intervals throughout the day The calorie value associated with an Activity Heart Rate-recorded session is calculated from the selected activity type, duration, and intensity (same as a manually added activity).

How Oura Measures Steps How Oura Measures Activity How Oura Calculates with METs What Is Active Calorie Burn? What Is Total Burn? More Information How Oura Measures Steps The Oura Ring registers all your daily movements and their intensities, from light housework to heavy workouts. From the gathered data, Oura's activity algorithms are fine-tuned to recognize steps from the rest of your daily movement. Oura is able to identify step patterns within a very small window of time (30 seconds) and with a high level of precision from your finger. Since total activity includes both step-based and non-step-based movements, it can vary based on several factors. Increasing or decreasing your step count, engaging in different activities each day, or wearing an Oura Ring on your dominant vs. non-dominant hand can all impact your daily activity. Other wearables or apps may show different step estimates because they use different methods of categorizing steps. Many trackers set a different threshold for what counts as "activity" while others categorize all movements as steps. How Oura Measures Activity The Oura Ring uses a 3D accelerometer to track activity, measuring movement in all directions. While it captures most daily activities well, accelerometers can have difficulty with activities that involve limited hand movement in one direction (for example, using an elliptical or lifting weights), no hand movement (for example, cycling), or intense movement isolated to your hands (for example, drumming). For more accurate activity tracking, make sure the ring's sensor bumps are on the palm side of your finger. For non-step-based activities that are more difficult to measure (for example, yoga), manually adding your activities on the Oura App can improve the accuracy of your Activity Score. On iOS, you can import your activities from Apple Health , and on Android, you can import activities from Health Connect by Android . How Oura Calculates with METs Oura calculates your daily energy expenditure using METs or Metabolic Equivalents. MET is a common measure used to express the energy expenditure and intensity of different physical activities. If an activity has a MET value of 4, it means you're burning four times as many calories as you would burn while resting. The time you spend doing activities with specific MET values can be expressed as MET minutes. For example: 30 min x brisk walking (MET value = 3) = 90 MET minutes 30 min x jogging (MET value = 7) = 210 MET minutes One MET corresponds with Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR), or the total number of calories burned while your body is completely at rest. This is part of what your body needs to sustain itself while you're awake. To provide accurate insights, Oura uses 1.5 METs as the lowest threshold for activities that contribute to your daily active calorie burn. This ensures you're only tracking calories burned through physical activity, not the calories your body uses while at rest. Sedentary vs. Physical Activities Sedentary activities, like sitting or watching TV, range from 1 to 1.5 METs. Active calories, on the other hand, such as activities like household chores, walking the dog, or dancing, have METs above 1.5. By using 1.5 METs as the threshold for active calories, Oura prevents you from logging large amounts of calories from low-intensity activities. This helps increase the accuracy of your Activity Score and other activity metrics without overstating calories burned during rest or light activities. What Is Active Calorie Burn? Active calorie burn is an estimate of the calories you burn over the course of the day through exercise or other activity. It captures the calories you've burned while walking, training, or partaking in other physical activities. Tracking your active calorie burn can help you balance your activity output and calorie intake. Active calorie burn can be found on the Oura App's home and Activity screens and appears as the numerator in your Activity Goal Progress. If you're looking to boost your activity levels in general, or achieve higher fitness goals, monitoring active calorie burn by paying attention to your Activity Goal Progress can help. When this numerator is higher, it means you've engaged in more intentional movement and activity. Paying attention to days when your active calorie burn is higher can also help you recognize the need for additional recovery time and refueling through proper nutrition and hydration. What Is Total Burn? Total burn, on the other hand, is the total number of calories you burn over the course of a full 24 hours, resting or otherwise. Every day, Oura begins calculating your total burn at 4 AM as your metabolism starts to gear up for all daytime functions and activities. This initial calculation is done using your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate), which is the number of calories your body needs to sustain itself and all your vital functions (i.e. breathing, digesting, circulating blood, etc.). Additional calories are added to your total burn count as you continue to move throughout the day and complete any form of exercise. Total burn can be found on your Activity screen, above your step count. Keep in mind that if you don't wear your ring while engaging in physical activity, your active calorie burn may be slightly off. This is why we recommend manually adding activities or importing your activities from third-party apps to ensure that your active calorie burn is reflective of all your effort.

How to Use Discovery Hub The Oura App needs data from at least 14 of the past 30 days to establish a baseline reading before generating a new discovery. Be sure to wear your ring each night and tag frequently and consistently to generate correlated data for more discoveries. When a discovery is available, a notification card will appear on the Oura App home screen. Tap the notification to open the Trends screen —available discoveries are shown in the Discovery Hub located beneath the trend graph. Certain habits and activities require just a few days of consistent tagging to produce a discovery, but others may take longer. Personal discoveries are applicable only to certain metrics and are shown on the following trend screens: Readiness: Heart rate variability (HRV), Respiratory rate, Resting heart rate (RHR) Sleep: Deep sleep, REM sleep, Sleep efficiency, Total sleep What Are Community Discoveries? Community discoveries show the average impact of certain tags across all of Oura's member population. For example, when you tap on the Trends view for REM sleep, you may see that having a wind down routine or sauna improves REM sleep on average for Oura members, while alcohol decreases it. These discoveries are based on statistical significance: enough members have to show the same correlation in order for it to be considered a "Community Discovery." Tags won't necessarily have the same impact on you as they do on other members. Every personal health journey is unique and many factors contribute to changes in biometric data. Community discoveries are available on the trend screens for the following metrics: Readiness: Heart rate variability (HRV), Respiratory rate, Resting heart rate (RHR) Sleep: Deep sleep, Latency, REM sleep, Sleep efficiency, Total sleep Things to Keep in Mind Discoveries are not available for custom tags or repeating tags. See our Using Tags article for more information Although discoveries suggest correlations between your tags and biometrics, other factors can also contribute to changes in your data It's possible for tags to have little or no impact on your health data The Oura Ring is not a medical device and is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, monitor, or prevent medical conditions or illnesses. Please do not make any changes to your medication, nutrition, or workouts without first consulting your doctor or another medical professional.

Oura Insight Messages – Oura Help Why Oura How It Works For Business Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Accessibility Why Oura How It Works For Business My Requests Shop Oura Help Oura App App Features Insights & Reports Articles in this section Discovery Hub Oura Insight Messages Oura Reports Using Trends Using Tags Reflections Oura Experiments Oura Circles Oura Stickers Oura Labs Export & Share Your Oura Data Oura Insight Messages In this article, you'll find a more information on your Oura insight messages and how to get the most out of them. What Are Oura Insights? How to Use Oura Insights Oura Scores and Contributor Ratings What Is the Crown Icon? Things to Keep in Mind What Are Oura Insights? Oura insight messages are simple guidance tips that are displayed on the Home tab of your Oura App. They are designed to highlight notable patterns in your data, such as a specific trend in your sleep staging or resting heart rate graph, or an unusual reading that may signal that something is deviating from your normal baseline. How to Use Oura Insights Oura insight messages are located within the Readiness, Sleep, and Activity Goal Progress cards on the Oura App's Home tab. If it's currently in the evening hours near your bedtime, your Readiness and Sleep cards will be reordered so your Bedtime Guidance card appears first. In addition to Readiness, Sleep, and Activity Goal Progress, Oura supplies you with insights following confirmation of a detected activity or nap . If you take and confirm a nap before 6 p.m., you'll see highlights of this additional rest in your Readiness and Sleep insights. Tap on your Readiness, Sleep, Activity Goal Progress, or Bedtime Guidance card to see the entire insight message and its associated graph. Readiness and Sleep insight messages are your "themes of the day." Your Readiness insight is meant to surface a crucial recovery, sleep, or activity metric for the day. Your Sleep insight is designed to extract a core finding from your overnight contributors and help you reflect on a component of your rest. Activity Goal Progress is a quick glimpse into how much you've moved your body in the current day so far. By tapping into your Activity Goal Progress card, you'll get the full picture of your movement trends over the course of the day, and when you may have been overly sedentary. Oura Scores and Contributor Ratings Readiness, Activity, and Sleep Scores — and their contributors — are rated on a scale of 0-100. 85-100: Optimal 70-84: Good 60-69: Fair 0-59: Pay Attention An 85 or higher may be a sign that you are ready to take on new challenges. Scores below 70 indicate that you may benefit from prioritizing rest and recovery in the indicated areas. What Is the Crown Icon? On days when your Readiness, Sleep, or Activity Score is 85 or higher, you'll see a crown icon next to your Readiness, Sleep, or Activity Scores. Things to Keep in Mind Looking at your long-term trends is more important than focusing on an individual night While comparing your scores with friends and family is a great way to remain motivated in improving sleep, recovery, and movement, we recommend not becoming too involved in this. When it comes to health, everyone is unique—which is why it's essential to discover your own normal ranges and goals Was this article helpful? 346 out of 399 found this helpful Return to top Related articles Oura Reports Cycle Insights Cardio Capacity (VO2 Max) Oura Membership Heart Rate Graph Social Our Company About Us Leadership Medical Advisory Board Careers Press The Pulse Blog Support My Account Sizing Oura on the Web Extra Charger Oura Memberships Contact © 2024 Oura Health Oy.

Trends in the Oura App How to View Trends Spotlight Trend Sleep Regularity in Trends Body Temperature Graph Trends in Oura on the Web Use Tags in Trends More Information What Are Trends? The Trends section of the Oura App displays information about your scores and contributors in easy-to-visualize charts and graphs. Viewing your Oura Ring data in the long term is a quick way to see if you are moving toward your personal goals, and to track which variables may impact your overall health. Each Trend graph, except for body temperature, provides daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly views . When reviewing a Trend graph, you'll typically see a value in a larger size at the top-left of the screen and a value in a smaller size at the left side of the graph. The value at the top-left of the screen is the most current data for that particular metric. The screenshot above shows the member's heart rate variability is 39 ms for the day. The value on the left side of the graph represents the average measurement of the displayed metric over a certain period. The screenshot above shows the member's average heart rate variability is 43 ms over the last 90 days. For Day view , the average measurement is taken over 90 days For Week view , Month view , and Year view , the average measurement is taken since the beginning of your data If you're in rest mode , your main goal is recovery, so you will see trends for contributors related to getting well. Trends in the Oura App How to View Trends Select the menu in the upper-left corner of the home screen Tap Trends At the top of the screen you'll find three featured trends, with a full list of Sleep , Readiness , Activity , and Stress metrics, as well as a Spotlight trend Tap any of these elements to view their trend graphs Spotlight Trend The Trends section features a Spotlight trend curated by Oura's science team according to the focus area you selected during the Oura App onboarding process . You also may see a Spotlight trend as a Home card if there is a significant change in one of your tracked metrics. You can change your focus area at any time, and your corresponding trends will update immediately: Select the menu in the upper-left corner of the home screen Select My profile Select My current goal For focus areas, Be more present and focused and Be productive and energetic require a minimum of seven days of data to start displaying Spotlight trends. The other focus areas require 7-8 weeks of data. Sleep Regularity in Trends Sleep regularity is a Readiness Score contributor that measures how consistent your bedtime and wake-up times have been. In the My Health tab or the Trends section of your Oura App, you can find data visualizations of your sleep regularity patterns by day, week, month, or year. Below the sleep regularity trend chart is a graph of your sleep timing, which shows your time in bed , time asleep , and any awake time interruptions during the night. The sleep timing chart represents the consistency of your sleep as vertical bars. The time you went to bed is at the top of the graph, with wake time at the bottom. Time in bed is visualized with a faint, dark blue bar. Time asleep is visualized with a solid, bright blue bar. Any interruptions to your sleep during the night appear as gaps in the bar. Scroll left and right to see more data. The y-axis of the chart is fixed to your median sleep time plus two hours. Any data outside that time, such as a very early bed time or very late wake up time, cuts off at the upper or lower edges of the graph. Weekly, monthly, and yearly views of your sleep regularity trends display averages of your sleep timing for those time periods. Body Temperature Graph Oura displays changes in your skin temperature as fluctuations (+/-) from your personal baseline. The closer the reading is to 0.0, the closer your current skin temperature is to your long-term average. The Daily view of the Body temperature graph displays the same value you see in your Readiness detail view—this value is the average of your skin temperature readings taken throughout the previous night. Each date in the Trend view displays a weighted average of how your body temperature varies from your baseline based on a three-day window. Days closer to the current date will have more of an impact on your readings. For more information on average body temperature readings, check out our article on Body Temperature . Trends in Oura on the Web Trends are also available through Oura on the Web . Sign in to Oura on the Web using your Oura account , and then click "Trends" on the left side of the screen.

While tags don't directly change your daily scores, you can observe how your habits, behavior, daily choices, and environment impact your biometrics by tagging and viewing these instances in your Trends charts. The Oura App offers over 100 searchable tags, including alcohol, caffeine, fasting, headache, late meal, meditation, melatonin, nap, sauna, sick, stress, travel, and more. If we do not have the tag you are looking for, you can create your own custom tag. How to Add and View Tags How to Edit or Delete Tags Custom Tags Smart Tags More Information How to Add and View Tags Open the Oura App You can add a tag under the timeline on the Today tab, or by tapping the + icon in the bottom right corner Tap Add a tag Select one or more tags from the list For each tag, set a start date and time. The start date and time should match the day and time the event that is being tagged begins. You can also add an end time or date, an optional comment, or set the tag as an event that occurs daily. Start time: The start time of a tag should reflect the start time and date of the event that is being captured with a tag. For example, if you add the tag, "magnesium," the start time is the time you took magnesium. If your bedroom felt hot last night and you wanted to tag "hot bedroom," you would tag the time you went to bed as that is the time the event of "hot bedroom" started End time: This is an optional field. End time should reflect the end time and date of the event being captured with a tag. Continuing with the "hot bedroom" example, the end time would be the time that your bedroom stopped feeling hot. Your end time can be more than 24 hours after the start time Occurring Daily: This is an optional toggle that can be used to capture an event occurring every day, at the same time. For example, if you take magnesium every evening at 8 pm, this toggle can be turned on to indicate the event occurs every day at 8 pm Tap Done to save the tag You can view saved tags in your timeline.

What Are Experiments? How to Use Experiments Join Experiment View Experiment Leave Experiment Experiment Reports More Information What Are Experiments? Oura Experiments are self-driven tests to help you discover how your habits impact the biosignals that Oura measures from your body. Each experiment lasts for a limited time period (for example, 14 days) and focuses on one daily habit. When you complete an experiment, you'll receive an Experiment Report with the results of how your scores or contributors were affected. The best time to start an Oura Experiment is when your day-to-day routine (your daily life) is as consistent as possible. If you introduce other new changes during the experiment, like a new diet, sleep, workout change, travel, etc., it will likely impact your results. Keep in mind that the goal is self-discovery, not perfection, so there's no need to stress if you miss some of the experiment days. The current experiment will test how your sleep efficiency, restfulness, and recovery index contributors are affected by reducing caffeine in the late afternoon. How to Use Experiments Join Experiment Tap Get Started on the Experiments notification card on the home screen This card will only appear if a new experiment is available on the Oura App You can also join an existing experiment at any time by tapping the menu in the upper-left corner of the home screen, then tap Experiments Fill out the short background questionnaire Tap Join experiment Once you've joined the experiment, you can let your friends know by tapping the Share with friends button View Experiment When you join an experiment, you'll receive notification cards on the home screen to tag your participation for the day.

If you are in multiple circles, you'll see them all listed in order based on the most number of reactions. Edit a Circle You can edit your circles through the Settings menu on the top right of the circle. You can rename the circle, change your nickname, see who is in the circle, or remove members. You will see a notification in your circles screen if you are removed from a circle. Use Reactions You can use pre-set emojis to react to the data in any member of your circle. The reactions will last 24 hours, and you can see who reacted to you at the bottom of the Circle screen. Currently, there is no way to communicate with members in your circle through any other way in the Oura App. View Past Data The graph for any member of a circle contains data for a two-week range. Press and hold on a graph, then drag sideways to view a member's scores for the previous days. Things to Keep in Mind You can only share your three main scores in your circles, but we plan on expanding to other data in the future. If a member doesn't sync their ring, they will not be able to see their scores for the days they don't sync, and other members in the circle will not be able to see their scores.

Cardiovascular Age – Oura Help Why Oura How It Works For Business Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Accessibility Why Oura How It Works For Business My Requests Shop Oura Help Oura App App Features Heart Health Articles in this section Cardiovascular Age Cardio Capacity (VO2 Max) Heart Rate Graph Live Heart Rate Troubleshooting Gaps in Heart Rate Graphs Cardiovascular Age Cardiovascular Age (CVA) is one of Oura's Heart Health measurements, designed with an eye toward your future health and longevity. The Cardiovascular Age feature is available on both Android and iOS to Oura members with active membership. What is Cardiovascular Age? How to Use Cardiovascular Age How Oura Measures Cardiovascular Age Things to Keep in Mind More Information What is Cardiovascular Age? Cardiovascular Age is an estimate of the health of your cardiovascular system in relation to your actual age. Your Cardiovascular Age is estimated by measuring your pulse wave velocity (PWV) and evaluating age-related changes in the shape of your heartbeat’s signal, which carry information about your arterial stiffness. Younger arteries are more elastic, expanding and contracting in response to changes in our blood flow. As we age, arteries tend to stiffen and lose some of their elasticity, and with this stiffening, the energy of the heartbeat can become a strain on the internal organs. CVA is affected by a number of factors, including diet, exercise, genetic predisposition, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and smoking. You can slow the aging of your cardiovascular system through regular exercise and changes to your lifestyle and habits. How to Use Cardiovascular Age Cardiovascular Age can be found in the Heart Health card, which is accessible either on the Home tab or through the sidebar menu. Cardiovascular Age requires at least 14 nights of data from the past 30 days in order to calibrate the first baseline reading. This preliminary baseline can change as your nighttime data accumulates. Wear your ring consistently at night to ensure that you receive regular, accurate readings. Once the calibration is complete, the app will display a chart of your CVA as compared to your actual age. Cardiovascular Age is divided into three levels: Lower than actual age: -5 years and below Aligned with actual age: between -5 and +5 years Higher than actual age: +5 years and higher Tap the CVA chart for an expanded view with more detail that includes your pulse wave velocity (PWV) in meters per second, along with recent tags and activities. You can scroll this graph back to view previous weeks' data. CVA is a slow-moving metric and lifestyle changes can take several weeks to show a noticeable effect in the app. How Oura Measures Cardiovascular Age Each heartbeat produces a wave through your arteries. The speed of this wave is called pulse wave velocity and is measured in meters per second (m/s). Cardiovascular Age utilizes the Oura Ring's photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors to calculate PWV, which indicates the stiffness and thickness of arterial walls, and then gets interpreted as an age estimate. Faster pulse waves are associated with less flexible arteries and a higher CVA. PPG technology works by shining a light onto your blood vessels. The intensity of the light reflected back onto a photodetector indicates the amount of blood in your blood vessel via a waveform. When combined with a person's sex, actual age, and height, Oura can tell what kind of waves correspond to certain levels of arterial stiffness. By measuring your wave shape during sleep, Oura then calculates an estimate of your arterial stiffness (which is expressed as age years). Watch this video about how Cardiovascular Age works: Things to Keep in Mind If your CVA is higher than your actual age, don't focus on the absolute number. Instead focus on the relative trend of your CVA over time. Regular exercise and changes to diet and other habits can help improve your Cardiovascular Age Although Cardio Capacity and Cardiovascular Age are both part of Oura's Heart Health feature, the two measurements do not have a direct impact on each other. Seeing an increase or decrease in one metric will not necessarily mean seeing an increase or decrease in the other Cardiovascular Age results may not be valid for users with certain medical conditions , including heart diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, or pacemakers If you do not see your CVA data after having worn your Oura Ring for at least 14 nights, go to My Profile in the menu of the Oura App and check that the following personal data has been entered: Sex assigned at birth Height: between 3'6" - 8'2" (1.1-2.5m) Age: between 15-120 The Oura Ring is not a medical device and is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, monitor, or prevent medical conditions or illnesses.

Cardio Capacity (VO2 Max) – Oura Help Why Oura How It Works For Business Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Accessibility Why Oura How It Works For Business My Requests Shop Oura Help Oura App App Features Heart Health Articles in this section Cardiovascular Age Cardio Capacity (VO2 Max) Heart Rate Graph Live Heart Rate Troubleshooting Gaps in Heart Rate Graphs Cardio Capacity (VO2 Max) Cardio Capacity is one of Oura's Heart Health measurements, designed with an eye toward your future health and longevity. The Cardio Capacity feature is available to active members. What Is Cardio Capacity? What Is VO2 Max? How to Use Cardio Capacity Walking Test Manually Added Data Future Me Things to Keep in Mind More Information What Is Cardio Capacity? Cardio Capacity is an age-adjusted estimate of your VO2 max reading, which is the maximum amount of oxygen your body is able to utilize during exercise. Cardio Capacity is a great measure of cardiorespiratory (aerobic) fitness because it signals how well your heart, blood vessels, and muscles work together. What Is VO2 Max? VO2 max, or maximal oxygen uptake, measures the maximum amount of oxygen an individual can utilize during intense, exhaustive exercise. VO2 max is generally measured in milliliters of oxygen used in one minute per kilogram of body weight (ml/kg/min). The greater your body's ability to supply oxygen to your muscles during sustained physical activity, the higher your VO2 max reading will be. VO2 max varies significantly among individuals according to many influences, including age, sex, fitness level, and genetics. While it is commonly regarded as an athletic performance indicator, VO2 max correlates well with longevity, and is therefore a useful metric for anyone interested in their health, not just athletes. How to Use Cardio Capacity You can locate Cardio Capacity in the Heart Health screen of the Oura App. The initial reading will show a number based on anthropometric data (age, sex, height, and weight) as entered in My profile under the Oura App menu. This number is an estimate only , based on population averages. Depending on your VO2 max number, your Cardio Capacity will fall into one of four levels: Peak: very high within your age group High: high within your age group Fair: average or slightly below average within your age group Low: below average within your age group For a more precise measurement of your Cardio Capacity, the Oura App will prompt you to complete a six-minute walking test. You can also manually add a VO2 max value if you have a lab test result or a VO2 max reading from a trusted source, such as another wearable. Walking Test Tap Take the walking test to start. Location services must be turned on for the app to measure your Cardio Capacity Make sure your phone is charged above 20% before taking the walking test and carry your phone with you for the entire route Walk at a brisk pace (as quickly as you can without running out of breath) Choose a straight, level route that avoids traffic lights , which may interrupt a steady walking pace Choose a route that avoids tunnels , which may interrupt GPS signal During the walking test, Oura will use the distance traveled and your heart rate to calculate your Cardio Capacity. Please note that because Oura uses the physical distance traveled to calculate your Cardio Capacity, the walking test cannot be performed on a treadmill. After completion of a walking test, the app will display a graph of any current and past measured Cardio Capacity. To better track your Cardio Capacity, we recommend that you take a walking test approximately once a month. Manually Added Data If you want to update your VO2 max with a value from an external source, select Add your current VO2 max to manually add a data point. Enter a number 1-100 and then select Done . Any VO2 max data can be deleted by swiping left on the entry and selecting Delete . Future Me Cardio Capacity naturally declines as you age. This decline can be mitigated with regular movement and exercise. The Future Me chart provides a visual representation of how your potential future Cardio Capacity compares to expected average decline. The dotted blue line represents how maintaining or increasing activity levels can improve your Cardio Capacity. The solid white line is a prediction of your Cardio Capacity based on your current activity levels and expected population-level decline. Both lines estimate how difficult or easy it would feel to climb several flights of stairs at different ages. Things to Keep in Mind The Oura walking test is not as accurate as a lab test, but is an easy and accessible way to understand your Cardio Capacity Performing the walking test at high altitude may have an impact on your Cardio Capacity results You may see gaps in your Cardio Capacity graph if you haven’t performed the walking test regularly. We recommend that you take a walking test approximately once a month Although Cardio Capacity and Cardiovascular Age are both part of Oura's Heart Health feature, the two measurements do not have a direct impact on each other. Seeing an increase or decrease in one metric will not necessarily mean seeing an increase or decrease in the other The Oura Ring is not a medical device and is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, monitor, or prevent medical conditions or illnesses.

The daytime heart rate graph is not available for Gen2 or older. What Is the Heart Rate Graph? 24-hour Heart Rate Trendline Live Heart Rate Restorative Time Stress Daytime Heart Rate Measurement Activity Heart Rate How to Use the Heart Rate Graph Things to Keep in Mind More Information What Is the Heart Rate Graph? The heart rate graph located on the home screen of the Oura App shows color-coded visualizations of your sleeping, daytime, stress, and activity heart rates, as well as periods of Restorative Time, all in the same chart. The heart rate graph includes the following components: 24-hour Heart Rate Trendline The 24-hour graph displays sleep resting heart rate in blue, Restorative Time in green, daytime stress in pink, and Activity Heart Rate in orange. The white trendline is the average of your heart rate readings throughout the 24-hour period. Nighttime heart rate graphs are also available on the Sleep and Readiness screens of the Oura App. Live Heart Rate The latest reading of your pulse is displayed as beats per minute (BPM) beneath the heart rate graph, with a time indication of how long ago the last update was measured. Tapping the heart next to this number will update it with your current pulse measurement. Check out the Live Heart Rate article for more information. Restorative Time Restorative Time marks moments during the day when your body falls into a restful recovery state. Tracking these moments is a good way to measure your readiness. For more information on getting the most out of this feature, see our Restorative Time article . Stress Moments where your body has felt high levels of physiological stress are marked in pink on the heart rate graph. For more information, see the Daytime Stress article . Daytime Heart Rate Measurement Oura takes measurements of your daytime heart rate for one full minute, every five minutes, using the Oura Ring's green LEDs. To preserve battery and maximize accuracy, a daytime heart rate measurement is only taken under optimal conditions, which include low movement and balanced average body temperature. Due to prioritizing these conditions, you may not receive an automatically updated heart rate for up to 30 minutes, but it can be manually updated at any time by using Live Heart Rate . Also note that "low movement" generally includes everyday actions, up to excessive motion associated with workouts. Activity Heart Rate The Activity Heart Rate feature is used to record your exercises. Heart rate measurements taken from physical activity are highlighted in orange on the graph. How to Use the Heart Rate Graph After your first full day of using the Oura Ring, the 24-hour heart rate graph displays as its own card on the Oura App's home screen (you may need to select " More" to display everything in the home screen). The graph shows heart rate beats per minute (BPM) for the current day (midnight to midnight). The most recent heart rate value (in BPM) is displayed beneath the graph, along with the Live Heart Rate button. Each x-axis division of the graph represents a 30-minute time window, and every individual colored dot within those divisions is a five-minute heart rate range. Longer vertical bars indicate clusters of readings that overlap within the same 30 minutes. The solid white trendline across the graph represents the average of all heart rate measurement. Dotted white lines indicate periods in which reliable data is not available. See the Troubleshooting Gaps in Heart Rate Graphs article for more information. Tap anywhere on the heart rate graph for more detail. Press and hold or drag your finger on the graph to see a thin, vertical blue line. This line shows your exact heart rate range during that timeframe. Swipe right on the graph to view heart rate data from previous days. Tap on any of the five core metrics (Restorative Time, Stress, Sleeping, Activity, and Daytime) to see more data. Select "Learn more" beneath each one for further information, including how to interpret your heart rate curves . Things to Keep in Mind Daytime Heart Rate and Live Heart Rate are not intended to record workouts. For accurate measurement of your pulse during exercise, see the Activity Heart Rate feature Excess movement or unusually low average body temperature may result in gaps in your heart rate graph data Confirmed naps appear as sleep (in blue) on the 24-hour daytime graph More Information Troubleshooting Gaps in Heart Rate Graphs Activity Heart Rate Restorative Time Live Heart Rate Daytime Heart Rate Daytime Stress Sleeping Heart Rate: Look for These 4 Patterns Was this article helpful? 190 out of 253 found this helpful Return to top Related articles Live Heart Rate Activity Heart Rate Cardiovascular Age Restorative Time Oura Membership Social Our Company About Us Leadership Medical Advisory Board Careers Press The Pulse Blog Support My Account Sizing Oura on the Web Extra Charger Oura Memberships Contact © 2024 Oura Health Oy.

Live Heart Rate is not available on Gen2 and older. What Is Live Heart Rate? How Live Heart Rate Works How to Use Live Heart Rate Things to Keep in Mind What Is Live Heart Rate? With Live Heart Rate, you can check your heart rate at any time during the day. Just tap to see your heart rate instantly. You can access Live Heart Rate through the 24-hour heart rate graph . How Live Heart Rate Works Oura uses green LEDs to measure your heart rate in real-time. The process uses photoplethysmography (PPG) technology at a frequency of 50Hz. PPG technology works by shining a light onto the surface of your skin. When this reaches your blood vessels, some of the light is reflected back onto a photodetector. The intensity of light reflected back captures the amount of blood in your blood vessel via a waveform. Depending on the color of light used, different biometrics can be captured through their unique waveforms. For example, when your blood vessels are expanded, more green light will be absorbed compared to when they're contracted. This phenomenon allows your pulse to be accurately taken. To gather an accurate pulse reading, you must remain relatively still for Live Heart Rate to take its full 10-second measurement. If Oura detects too much motion, your Live Heart Rate won't be available. How to Use Live Heart Rate 1. Go to your home screen to view your 24-hour heart rate graph. You'll see your most recent heart rate reading along with how recently it was updated. 2. Tap the large heart icon. If the conditions are right (balanced skin temperature, low motion, and a strong Bluetooth connection), it'll begin loading. Stay still for 10 full seconds or until your measurement is complete. 3. Once the reading is complete, your heart rate graph will update with your current heart rate in beats per minute (BPM). Things to Keep in Mind Several variables can interfere with a Live Heart Rate reading: Poor signal quality: check your device’s Bluetooth settings to confirm your ring and app are properly connected Low skin temperature: unusually low skin temperature may interfere with readings Excessive movement: make sure you hold still for 10 seconds during your measurement Incorrect ring orientation: make sure your ring's sensors always remain in contact with your skin, on the palm side of your finger Live Heart Rate is not the same as Activity Heart Rate , nor is it intended to be a constant heart rate monitor The green LEDs used to take your Live Heart Rate are designed for accuracy but require a stronger signal quality. Frequent use of Live Heart Rate will consume more battery, so we recommend charging your ring regularly to keep the battery in its optimal range.

A quick rinse could clear it up Please note: If you have a heart condition, low blood pressure, or any other health issue that causes arrhythmia, the Oura App may not be able to show your total resting heart rate (RHR) and heart rate variability (HRV) data, which may cause gaps in your graphs. In some cases, you might not see your heart rate and HRV data at all. For more information, read our article about Oura & Medical Conditions . You can perform a soft reset to help reset the ring's sensors: Go to the My Oura Ring page by tapping on the menu in the upper-left corner or the battery icon in the upper-right corner of the home screen On iOS, under Tools, tap Soft Reset On Android, swipe left > under Tools, tap Soft reset After checking the sensors and ring fit, and completing the soft reset (if necessary), please wear the ring for 24 hours to see if it correctly collects and syncs your daytime heart rate data. If it doesn't, please contact us for assistance. You can contact our Member Care Team here . Gaps in Activity Heart Rate Activity Heart Rate records heart rate across a selection of exercises, workouts, and other activities. If you see gaps in your Activity Heart Rate graph, check to see if any of the following apply: Cold skin or cold skin due to cold weather: Cold fingers can cause signal problems. Wearing gloves can help, but it’s important to put the gloves on before going outside Finger selection: Wearing your ring on your index finger is ideal for good signal quality, and the middle finger is the second best Tightness: A snug fit is most important, regardless of which finger you’re wearing your Oura Ring. You can tell you have a snug fit if the ring resists when you try to rotate it Ring positioning: In order to get an accurate Activity Heart Rate measure, the sensors should be on the bottom of the finger (on the palm side of your hand) Was this article helpful? 28034 out of 30034 found this helpful Return to top Related articles Ring Battery Tips Caring for Your Oura Ring Bedtime Guidance Automatic Firmware Updates Sleep Graphs Social Our Company About Us Leadership Medical Advisory Board Careers Press The Pulse Blog Support My Account Sizing Oura on the Web Extra Charger Oura Memberships Contact © 2024 Oura Health Oy.

Determining Your Fertile Window: In the Predictions section, you will notice certain days circled in white, indicating your estimated Fertile Window The Fertile Window spans from 5 days before ovulation, to 1 day after ovulation. It represents the days in which you're most likely to conceive during your current cycle Your Fertile Window estimate is based on physiological data captured by the software, and information you provide about your cycle. Remember to log each day of your period to keep your predictions accurate and up-to-date. If you don’t have a period during a cycle, wait until the end of your luteal phase when your temperature drops, and log a period with “no flow.” The ovulation and Fertile Window cannot be predicted if periods are not logged accurately In the Predictions section, you will also see one day highlighted in light blue. This indicates today's date 4. Your Estimated Ovulation Day Within your estimated fertile window, one day will be marked with a solid, white icon of an egg. This is your estimated ovulation day Seeing All Future Predictions In Your Calendar The Predictions section will only show one predicted cycle event at a time—either your estimated Fertile Window or your next expected period If you’d like to see all your upcoming predictions at once, tap the blue "View calendar" button Once in your Calendar, you can see your estimated Fertile Window, ovulation day, and upcoming period all in the same place The days within your estimated Fertile Window will be marked with white circles. Your estimated ovulation day will be marked with a solid white icon of an egg The days circled in red represent the range of days in which your period is estimated to begin The day highlighted in light blue indicates today’s date Your Fertile Window And The Daily Temperature Graph Before Ovulation Is Detected: Before ovulation is detected, Oura creates estimates for your ovulation day and Fertile Window. Your Fertile Window spans from 5 days before you ovulate to 1 day after Your Daily Temperature graph shows you how your temperature rises and falls each day compared to your baseline throughout your cycle On days when you’re in your Estimated Fertile Window, your “Chance of conception” will be marked as “High,” accompanied by an icon of a meter with a high reading When you’re outside your estimated Fertile Window, your “Chance of conception” will be marked as “Low,” next to an icon of a meter with a low reading Please note that your estimates can change. Cycle Insights will update to reflect these changes, but your estimates should not be used as a form of birth control. After Ovulation Is Detected: Oura observes your physiology for at least two days before confirming ovulation, as many factors can cause a rise in basal body temperature Once ovulation has been detected, your confirmed ovulation day will be marked on the bottom of your temperature graph with a solid white icon of an egg In addition, your “Chance of conception” will be marked as “Ovulation detected.” After ovulation has been detected, your Fertile Window will shift from “estimated” to “confirmed,” and the dates of your Fertile Window will be set for the remainder of your cycle When you scroll back through previous days in your cycle, your confirmed Fertile Window days will be represented by a dot icon beneath the temperature line on your Daily Temperature graph, and the span of your fertile window will be highlighted with a white background In addition, you will find "Chance of conception" marked as "High" for these days, next to an icon of a meter with a high reading After ovulation has been detected, days outside of your Fertile Window will have no accompanying icon on your Daily Temperature graph.

Cycle Insights – Oura Help Why Oura How It Works For Business Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Accessibility Why Oura How It Works For Business My Requests Shop Oura Help Oura App App Features Women's Health Articles in this section Feature Availability Fertile Window User Manual Pregnancy Insights Cycle Insights How to Use Natural Cycles with Oura Cycle Insights Cycle Insights highlights which phase of your cycle you're in, allowing you to learn more about how your body changes within each phase. What is Cycle Insights? How Cycle Insights Works How to Use Cycle Insights Cycle Phases Period Prediction Fertile Window How to Remove Your Women's Health Data from the Oura App How to Turn Off Cycle Insights Things to Keep in Mind More Information What Is Cycle Insights? Cycle Insights allows members to better understand their full cycle by tracking the two main phases, follicular and luteal. Cycle Insights allows members to predict their period and also provides information about how the full cycle impacts the entire body. The feature is available to Gen3 members and newer. How Cycle Insights Works Different hormone levels in each phase contribute to natural temperature fluctuations in the menstrual cycle. Cycle Insights uses these temperature deviations to accurately track, predict, and visualize your monthly cycle. Readiness Score also takes into account natural biometric fluctuations during the menstrual cycle. The feature is designed for individuals who have a menstrual cycle and a natural hormonal cycle. Cycle Phases The menstrual cycle has two main phases, the follicular phase and the luteal phase. During the follicular phase, which is from the first day of menstruation to ovulation, rising estrogen levels may cause your average body temperature to decrease. During the luteal phase, from ovulation until the next menstruation, rising progesterone levels usually elevate your average body temperature. You'll need at least 60 nights of data in order for the Oura Ring to learn your unique cycle phases. Period Prediction Oura uses your nightly average body temperature, along with other biosignals like HRV, to make your multi-day period prediction window. Your period prediction windows are created from comprehensive data that builds over time, not single intakes. Historically, most period tracking solutions rely on the calendar method, which uses your last period start date and a user-inputted cycle length to predict the start of your next cycle. However, periods can change from cycle to cycle and be impacted by various factors like stress, diet, and illness. Cycle Stats Cycle stats show your typical cycle length, cycle variability, and period length. These are each based on the medians of the cycles you've logged over the past six months. Cycle length is defined as the time between the first day of your period and the day before your next period begins. Cycles that last between 21 and 35 days are considered regular. Cycle variability refers to the differences in the length of your cycles over time. Cycle variability of +/- three days or less is considered regular. Period length is defined as the time between your first and last day of menstrual bleeding. Periods that last between two and eight days are considered regular. Your cycle stats rely on your period tags for the last six months, so it's important to log your period start date and each day of your period to get the most accurate data. Many factors can contribute to changes in cycle variability, and a single instance of an irregular cycle variability is typically fine. However, if you're experiencing consistent irregularity in your cycle length, or have questions about your cycle in general, consult with your doctor. Fertile Window Fertile Window will provide you with more information on your chances of getting pregnant throughout your cycle. When using Cycle Insights, you will now have a view of your estimated peak fertility, chance of conception, predicted ovulation day, and when ovulation has been detected. The Fertile Window is the time during your cycle when you're most likely to conceive. It spans from five days before ovulation to one day after, making it a total of seven days, including ovulation day. This estimate is based on your physiological data—such as cardiovascular metrics, temperature trends, and respiratory metrics—as well as the cycle information you provide. In some cases, people may have cycles without menstruating. If you don't have a period during a cycle, wait until the end of your luteal phase when your temperature drops, and log a period with "no flow." The ovulation and Fertile Window cannot be predicted if periods are not logged accurately. Your Estimated Ovulation Day Within your estimated Fertile Window, one day will be highlighted as your estimated ovulation day, marked by a solid white egg icon. This day represents the time when ovulation is most likely to occur. Tracking Your Fertile Window In the Predictions section of the app, you can see either your Fertile Window (marked with white circles) or your next expected period (marked with red circles). To view all upcoming cycle events, tap View calendar. Your Daily Temperature graph shows you how your temperature rises and falls each day compared to your baseline throughout your cycle. Before Ovulation is Detected Before ovulation is detected, Oura creates estimates for your ovulation day and Fertile Window. The Chance of Conception will be shown as "High" during this window Outside the Fertile Window, the chance is marked as "Low" Your estimates may change as new data is collected, but they should not be used as a form of birth control After Ovulation is Detected Ovulation is confirmed when Oura observes a consistent rise in your basal body temperature or you tag "Positive LH Test." Once ovulation is detected: Your confirmed ovulation day will be marked with a solid white egg icon on your temperature graph Your Fertile Window will shift from "estimated" to "confirmed," with high conception chances marked for those days Days outside the Fertile Window will have no icons, and the Chance of Conception will be shown as "Low" Because the Fertile Window is a regulated feature, it's available only in countries where the regulatory process is completed. See the Feature Availability list here. You can find the Fertile Window User Manual here. For more information, see What is the Fertile Window? on The Pulse Blog . How to Use Cycle Insights Members new to Cycle Insights will see a home card about the feature and be guided through an onboarding flow, which includes a few questions on your cycle, including when your last period started, how long your cycle typically is, and whether you use hormonal contraceptives or other hormones. If you use hormonal contraceptives or hormones, your natural temperature deviation may be impacted. You can still use Cycle Insights, but you will only see period predictions and not cycle phases, related insights, or Fertile Window. You can update your answer to the hormone question at any time in the Settings menu. In order to see cycle phases, you must confirm the start date of your period each month by using the "Log period" button via the Cycle Insights home card or detailed view, or the + button on the bottom right of the app. If you change the date of your period start, or log it retroactively, your cycle phases will update. As you continue to accumulate more temperature data by wearing your Oura Ring 24/7, and confirming or logging the exact start date of your period each month, your predictions will become more accurate. Using any tags (for example, "Positive LH test") will not indicate when new cycles begin and, therefore, not display cycle phases. You will see Cycle Insights in the Today tab. Tap on the Cycle Insights home card or shortcut to find additional information about your temperature and your cycle history. In the detailed view, you'll be able to see the below data: Average body temperature metric from last night What phase you're currently in (blue for follicular phase and purple for luteal phase) What day of your cycle you're on Educational information related to your current phase Estimated next period start The ability to log every day of your period, as well as your flow levels An option to click to the calendar view Cycle stats such as typical cycle length, cycle variability, and period length Chance of conception Additional resources about the menstrual cycle A shareable report of your last six months of data for cycle length, period length, temperature variation, cycle phases, and symptom tags To delete a period entry: Tap on the Cycle Insights home card to see the detailed view Under the temperature graph, you can log or edit your period You can use the Calendar view to edit or delete (logged period dates will be highlighted by a red circle on the calendar) How to Remove Your Women's Health Data from the Oura App Women's Health data may include information about your cycles, such as your latest period start date and cycle length, women's health-related tags (such as positive pregnancy test, ovulation, positive LH test, etc.), period prediction settings, reproductive hormone answers, pregnancy information, and fertile window. Your data is collected, used, and protected in compliance with Oura's Privacy Policy . You can remove your data from the app at any time in the Settings menu under Women’s Health. Removing your data will disable all Women's Health features in the Oura App. If you would like to delete from Oura’s servers completely, you can choose Delete account and all data in the Settings menu or through Oura on the Web . See How Oura Protects Your Data . Read about our commitment to reproductive health data privacy on The Pulse Blog . How to Turn Off Cycle Insights You can choose to turn on or off the Cycle Insights feature at any point in time. Tap the menu icon in the upper-left corner of your home screen > Select Settings > Women's Health. You can use the toggle to turn off the entire Cycle Insights feature. Turning off Cycle Insights will pause period predictions and hide all cycle-related data. Things to Keep in Mind Wear your ring on a consistent, 24/7 basis, and sync it to the app regularly, to help build a robust temperature data profile You need 60 nights of temperature data to display cycle phases. Without 60 days of data, you will only see your period prediction based on the calendar method The calendar view in the Oura App will only show logged period dates, period prediction windows, and Fertile Window. It currently will not show cycle phase data If you're currently taking a hormonal contraceptive or are pregnant, because your body's natural temperature variation is impacted as a result, Cycle Insights may not be able to accurately assess the timing of your period (if you still menstruate under these circumstances) or show your cycle phases. This is because regardless of the hormonal contraceptive being used, your cyclical variations, overall cycle length, and bleeding tendencies are all likely to deviate from your body's natural patterns Using the tag "positive pregnancy test" will automatically disable both Cycle Insights and period predictions. You can go into your Settings at any time and reenable the feature Medical factors such as infertility and fertility treatments, endometriosis, pregnancy, breastfeeding, overtraining, weight loss, stress, etc. can also have an impact on the key biosignals. If any of these apply to you, this may impact Oura's ability to accurately and consistently predict your period and cycle phases each month Only one period can be logged per calendar month, and data integrations from other period-tracking apps such as Apple Health or Clue are not currently available Fertile Window is intended to help women who are trying to conceive understand their cycle better and see their ovulation predictions, detection, and chance of conception. Fertile Window is complementary to our partnership with Natural Cycles. Natural Cycles is FDA-cleared as a Class II medical device, which means that it can be used as a reliable birth control method in the US, and has a conception mode to aid in trying to conceive. We encourage our members to select the feature set that is right for them based on their goals and preferred user experience.

Unguided Sessions – Oura Help Why Oura How It Works For Business Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Accessibility Why Oura How It Works For Business My Requests Shop Oura Help Oura App App Features Mindfulness & Meditation Articles in this section Explore Content Unguided Sessions Restorative Time Restful Periods Unguided Sessions Unguided sessions are part of Oura's suite of mindfulness and meditation features. An ever-growing library of guided meditation programs, sleep stories, and other multimedia can be accessed through the Explore content . How Unguided Sessions Work How to Use Unguided Sessions Things to Keep in Mind How Unguided Sessions Work Unguided sessions provide a timer and an optional soundscape for use during your meditation practice. When you start an unguided session, all of the sensors in your Oura Ring activate on a continuous cycle. This provides biofeedback insights at the end of each session so that you can see the benefits of your mindfulness routine. 1-2 minute sessions will show your lowest resting heart rate (RHR) 3-5 minute sessions will display your lowest RHR and your average heart rate variability (HRV) 5+ minute sessions will show RHR, HRV, and skin temperature trends Lower RHR values, higher HRV, and slightly increased skin temperature variation are generally indicators of positive effects on your body. Increased skin temperature variation may be a sign of relaxation response activation: as your heart rate lowers and your blood vessels open up as a result, more blood circulates through your skin, leading to a slight increase in average body temperature. Unguided sessions can be useful in managing stress and anxiety, relaxing before bed, and releasing body tension. How to Use Unguided Sessions To use an Unguided Session: Tap the + in the lower-right corner of the Oura App's home screen. Select Unguided session Select your desired session time. Open-ended sessions will run until you manually stop them, up to a maximum of 180 minutes Unguided sessions come without voice instruction, but you can select an optional soundscape, adjust volume, and toggle the session end chime on or off Select Start You can end timed sessions at any point by selecting End early . Open-ended sessions can be stopped by selecting End session Select an answer to the "How do you feel?" questionnaire View session results. You can send this data to Apple Health or Health Connect by Android if you've enabled sharing with third-party apps Previous sessions can be viewed from the app's Home screen under "Timeline" Sessions can be deleted by selecting Delete session at the bottom of a "Session details" card Things to Keep in Mind Try to remain still during unguided sessions. Excess movement can interfere with the ring sensors' ability to take accurate measurements and may result in incomplete data. You may need to charge your ring more frequently because unguided sessions use all of your ring's sensors continuously. Read more about ring battery tips . Your ring and app do not need to be connected during a session. To see your post-session data, simply sync your ring and app upon completion. You can use a separate audio app while taking an unguided session. Simply start a session without a soundscape, then launch an audio app of your choice. Make sure you do not force quit your Oura App, or your session will not be recorded.

Restorative Time – Oura Help Why Oura How It Works For Business Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Accessibility Why Oura How It Works For Business My Requests Shop Oura Help Oura App App Features Mindfulness & Meditation Articles in this section Explore Content Unguided Sessions Restorative Time Restful Periods Restorative Time Restorative time is the amount of time your body has spent in a calm and restored state. Restorative Time is not available on Oura Ring Gen2 or older. What is Restorative Time? How Restorative Time Works How to Use Restorative Time Get the Most Out of It Things to Keep in Mind More Information What is Restorative Time? Restorative Time represents periods during the day when your body and mind are recharging. Health is all about balance, and part of benefiting from an active life is making time for recovery, too. With the help of your readiness data and insights, Oura notifies you when your body might be experiencing additional stress. By staying mindful of your Restorative Time, you can see whether you're giving your body the rest it needs to recover. How Restorative Time Works Restorative Time is recorded when your ring detects that your heart rate variability (HRV) is up. In general, higher HRV is associated with rest-and-digest, general fitness, and good recovery. How to Use Restorative Time From the home screen, you can tap on the 24-hour heart rate graph to view it in detail. Tap on Restorative Time to see when, how often, and how much you've experienced moments of relaxation throughout your day. Your Restorative Time is highlighted in green on your main graph and timeline. The timeline view under the graph covers your day from the moment you wake up until midnight. Each green dot represents 15 minutes of Restorative Time, while larger clusters of green indicate longer, continuous periods of rest. These green dots and segments on your timeline correspond with the vertical green bars in your main heart rate graph, making it easy to see when your body has entered a relaxed state. Pay attention to when and where your clusters of Restorative Time appear, and how they’re spread out across your day. This can help you reflect on when you’ve allowed your body and mind to unwind and think back to the activities or moments that may have contributed to those restorative periods. You'll also find Restorative Time highlighted in the Restored zone of your Daytime Stress graph. This zone reflects moments when your body is shifting away from stress and into recovery. Tap on the Restored box, and you can view your daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly trends. Ideally, you'll get Restorative Time throughout the day. If you only experience calm near bedtime or early in the morning, you may not be optimally supporting your ability to recover, learn, and perform. How to Get the Most Out of Restorative Time Restorative Time can help you manage stress and support recovery. By regularly checking your heart rate graph, you can see if you're getting enough Restorative Time throughout the day or if you need to prioritize more moments of rest. At the end of each day, you can also reflect on whether you had enough moments of relaxation distributed across your waking hours. Everyone's needs for Restorative Time are different. Your ideal amount of rest will depend on your lifestyle and daily routines. Over time, you'll learn what works best for you, helping you find a balance that supports both your physical and mental well-being. Try to take short breaks between your daily activities. Sit down for a cup of tea, read, or catch up with a friend or family member—anything you find relaxing or rewarding. Things to Keep in Mind It takes approximately 30 days for Oura to calibrate to your 24-hour heart rate averages and overnight temperature deviation to start receiving fully accurate measurements. You'll still see your Restorative Time during this calibration period Any completed meditation and breathwork sessions from Explore will be incorporated into your total Restorative Time Unconfirmed and confirmed naps are not considered Restorative Time, nor incorporated into your total If you previously used an Oura Ring Gen2, you may recall seeing Restful periods reflected beneath your daily activities. Restful periods are not the same as Restorative Time. Restorative Time takes a more holistic and refined look at your daily rest and recovery, though the general approach to tracking Restful periods is still taken into consideration Restorative Time is not the same as Recovery time or Recovery index, which are both contributors to your Activity and Readiness Scores Turning on Rest Mode does not impact the amount of Restorative Time shown in your data More Information Heart Rate Graph Heart Rate Variability How To Increase Your HRV (Heart Rate Variability) Explore Content Was this article helpful? 411 out of 449 found this helpful Return to top Related articles Heart Rate Graph Explore Content Resilience Set Up an Oura Ring Readiness Contributors Social Our Company About Us Leadership Medical Advisory Board Careers Press The Pulse Blog Support My Account Sizing Oura on the Web Extra Charger Oura Memberships Contact © 2024 Oura Health Oy.

Restful Periods – Oura Help Why Oura How It Works For Business Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Accessibility Why Oura How It Works For Business My Requests Shop Oura Help Oura App App Features Mindfulness & Meditation Articles in this section Explore Content Unguided Sessions Restorative Time Restful Periods Restful Periods This feature only applies to the Oura Ring Generation 2. It has been replaced by Restorative Time for newer generation rings. Restful Periods include naps, meditation, and breathing exercises, among other activities. Whenever Oura senses that you're resting, it logs a restful period. Restful Periods can even include lying on the sofa, watching TV, or reading a book. Restful Periods can be a major complement to your overall recovery and allow your body to repair and recover during the day. Because Oura only tracks one sleep period during each 24-hour segment, Restful Periods are meant to serve as an opportunity to give yourself added time to unwind. Restful Periods in the Oura App Oura uses several measurements, including decreased movement and average body temperature, to detect Restful Periods. Restful Periods aren't taken into account when your Readiness Score is calculated. Rest reports include your lowest resting heart rate (RHR), along with your average heart rate variability (HRV), otherwise known as the two key pillars of recovery. Here is how you should expect to see your Restful Periods on the Oura App home screen: Noticing RHR and HRV scores in your rest reports that resemble those captured during your sleep are positive signals that your Restful Periods are serving you well. Naps and other forms of rest throughout the day can help you relax, reduce fatigue, and increase your alertness. However, be wary of taking naps in the afternoon past 3:00 pm, as these can interrupt or delay your sleep.
