From headlines to keynote speeches to investment pitches, AI is ubiquitous, expected to reshape everything from consumer products to business workflows to everyday tasks and entire industries. The scale and pace of the transformation is breathtaking. The rapid adoption of generative AI (300M weekly active users of ChatGPT) and the frenzy of innovation and investment in it (just look at NVIDIA’s market capitalization) signals a tectonic shift in consumer behavior, the power dynamics of Big Tech and the technology foundations of the products and services we use every day. The impact of AI can be framed as a 10X on human productivity or the latest phase in the fourth industrial revolution, or both. It would be easy to assume that the AI revolution is a recent phenomenon—and there’s some truth to that. But AI researchers have been working for decades, building the foundations of AI; neural networks, expert systems, big data, deep learning, unsupervised learning, and natural language processing, along with a few “AI winters,” all precede this current moment of unbridled optimism. Fueled by massive scale of data, processing power, low-cost storage, and hundreds of other advances, generative AI emerged, revolutionizing the way we engage with technology in our daily lives. The experience matters for ŌURA From the beginning of our decade-long journey, AI and machine learning have been essential to our mission to make health a daily practice. While we have been using machine learning and neural networks to power sensing and health insights before it became fashionable to stick “AI-powered” on the front of the box, we’ve never made a big fuss about it. Our philosophy is that technology should “just work.” To paraphrase Arthur C. Clarke, advanced technology should feel like magic. That’s because our mission is not about technology—it’s about the tangible ways we’re improving our members’ lives: helping them sleep better, move their bodies more, find balance, develop healthy habits, and provide insights and learning, all in service of enabling a unique individual to discover what works for them. We love new technology, but tech for tech’s sake is not the goal; making a positive impact is. We want to give every body a voice. If you have ever used Oura Ring, you have already experienced how AI-powered algorithms are used to help you tune into your life. To me, when Oura gets it right, it does feel like magic. I vividly remember when Oura suggested “dancing” with Automatic Activity Detection (AAD) after a night at a wedding and “pickleball” the first time I ever played the game. I’ve spoken to members who save and share screenshots of their Oura App on critical days of their life: when they first learned they were pregnant, Oura exhorting them to “bring it on” the morning before an NBA championship game, or their stress graph at the moment they received life-changing news. New generations of AI allow Oura to be even better at detecting, predicting, and proactively communicating meaningful changes in your health—whether Oura is delivering insights about your sleep last night or warning you when you might be getting sick. Over the years, we’ve been intentional and proactive about iterating on our AI-powered algorithms to reflect the latest technology, like introducing a new Sleep staging algorithm 2.0 in 2022. With a massive sleep dataset with gold-standard reference data and the improvements enabled by multiple input metrics, it was clear that the new algorithm was more accurate. This highlights a key truth about AI: the best training data produces the best results. That’s why we invest millions of dollars in research and time to make our neural network AI algorithms as accurate as possible across the widest span of humanity. In talking to members about our AI-powered Oura Advisor (available in Oura Labs today on iOS and Android), I’ve heard similar stories of surprise. Like when a member told me that he loved that Oura Advisor continually reminded him to take a walk with his dog, Jackson. (And yes, he does have a dog, and his dog IS named Jackson) Or when we heard from members who used our earliest iteration that they felt so strongly attached to their Oura Advisor, they wanted to give it a personal name. Whenever Oura Advisor references my busy travel schedule (which it does often), I feel like Oura knows me. One thing I will say about large language models, they are infinitely patient—a stellar quality in a coach, friend, or advisor. It’s early days yet, but you can see where we are headed: everyone already has a supercomputer in their pocket, everyone should have a wearable monitoring health data, and an algorithmic intelligence should be watching over you with the goal of supporting you in living a long and healthy life, leveraging the best science and the latest medical knowledge. And it should be tuned to you and your unique physiology, genetics, history, health status, age, gender, and habits. It’s a big vision. We have much to do to make it a reality, but we must start from a strong foundation. Building a foundation for the future of Human Care With AI advancing faster than ever, we are compelled to take a clear stance on how AI technology can and should be used. Our commitment is to harness AI responsibly, ensuring that Oura empowers you with trustworthy, actionable insights that put you and your health first. AI is a remarkable step forward in technology, but it’s not a panacea. More importantly, technology alone isn’t enough; we believe well-being is rooted in compassion and connection. Because the future we imagine isn’t driven by just innovation and technology, our vision is guided by care, community, and the fundamental values that make Oura who we are. We are human first. We earn trust. We aim higher. We believe in a balanced approach because it is in our DNA. That approach combines the best of engineering, science, and design—and, yes, AI—to create real, meaningful impact. AI’s power comes from being integrated with years of trusted, accurate data, a strong commitment to privacy, rigorous science, and human expertise. Here’s why: AI is only as good as the data behind it. The effectiveness of AI depends on the quality of the data that feeds it. At Oura, we have more than a decade’s worth of high-fidelity data from millions of members, providing rich, high-quality input. This deep, diverse data allows our AI algorithms to understand your unique health patterns. Privacy and security are non-negotiable . In today’s digital world, protecting your privacy is more important than ever. While AI presents incredible opportunities, it also raises important questions about data privacy. At Oura, safeguarding your sensitive data through encryption and anonymization is a top priority. Ou r vision is what we refer to as “private AI,” where AI insights are processed and generated on-device. This execution will help protect privacy and enable more personalized experiences and care: imagine a model trained on your data, the N-of-1 AI that is optimized for you, rooted in the strong privacy, security, and encryption on a computing device that is owned by you. AI insights require context to have meaning. When we think about a device you wear 24/7 that measures advanced biometrics consistently throughout the day for months—even years on end—that’s a lot of data. C ollecting data is necessary but insufficient; it’s how we analyze and make sense of that data that makes the difference. AI will augment, not replace, human care . One of the most common arguments I hear against AI is the idea that it diminishes our humanity. I will go out on a limb here: AI will not replace the compassion that defines genuine human care. But increasingly powerful algorithms will enhance human expertise, analyze complex data, spot patterns, and identify insights far faster and more effectively than any human could alone. By pairing AI’s capabilities with continuous data from a wearable like Oura Ring, we see a future where caregivers and their clinicians gain a deeper understanding of an individual’s health, enabling more effective, more personalized, more proactive care. And most importantly, people can better care for themselves. A healthcare executive from our partner, Essence Health, framed it this way: we simply do not have enough trained caregivers and clinicians. In the US, we have roughly 500 million hours of care per year from the ~270K doctors providing primary care. That is approximately 1.5 hours of care per person per year, on average, but we all know that care is not equally distributed. According to the American Association of Medical Colleges , the situation is not getting better. Outside the US, the situation is far worse. AI has the potential to solve this problem but must get the foundation right. That’s why Oura has invested in complying with the rules of HIPAA. It’s why we partner with world-class research institutions. It’s why we have 25 PhDs doing research and teams supporting large-scale studies. It’s why our AI investment and team have tripled in size over the last year. It’s why every Oura employee wakes up in the morning motivated to make a difference. But we cannot do it all by ourselves. Technology leadership for AI at the edge One of our partners is webAI, an innovative AI technology company that delivers a platform for intelligence to operate securely, scale autonomously, and evolve with users’ needs. While some processes, like population-level algorithms or complex model training, may leverage cloud or hybrid architectures, their platform dynamically optimizes workloads across the edge and the cloud. This flexibility ensures that each task runs where it makes the most sense. To optimize for privacy, performance, and user experience, in the future, we aim to maximize processing on-device. Of course, not every AI-powered process or feature will move to the edge, and it will not happen all at once. With privacy at the forefront, we will iterate and evolve along with the rapidly developing technology. Getting the foundation right means that Oura can focus on our strengths: accuracy, AI-driven algorithm development, science, and a human-first user experience. Our vision of private AI is already taking shape, and we are excited about a future enabled by cutting-edge AI technology and our deep knowledge of human health. Imagine Oura’s AI-powered future: A health assistant in your pocket that enables individuals to be the CEOs of their own health journey, enabling healthy habits that can mitigate the risk of more serious conditions over time. Clinical support for care teams that collects and summarizes patient information helps to manage aftercare, and supports a patient in between care visits. An advisor for chronic care management that understands a patient’s individual biometrics, provides compassionate guidance, and helps to identify triggers, manage symptoms, and support long-term well-being for those with chronic diseases. A performance coach that can adapt and adjust to changes over time, modify support for schedule changes, illness, or injury, and scale to support populations accessibly and affordably. Alan Kay famously said, “The best way to predict the future is to invent it.” That is the Oura journey. We do things the Oura way, not the way everyone else does. To our employees who are building Oura and features like Advisor, Symptom Radar, Meals, and Insights, thank you. I am grateful every day for your important work. To our partners: thank you for joining us, enabling us, and supporting us. Most importantly, thank you to our members. Your trust and support are what make this journey possible. We are inspired by the community that drives us forward. Together, we are shaping the future of health—powered by AI, guided by privacy, and driven by a commitment to human well-being.

Blood oxygen sensing (SpO2) By detecting your blood oxygen levels at night, Oura can tell if you're experiencing any breathing disturbances that may interrupt your sleep. Accuracy Above All The Oura Ring is designed for accuracy above all because it measures from the palm side of your finger, where the pulse signal is strong — much stronger than the top of your wrist (doctors measure your heart rate from your finger for a reason). Measure Your HRV Your Sleep Score is made up of seven Sleep Contributors including sleep stages (deep sleep, light sleep, REM), timing, and efficiency. Health Stats Oura Ring records heart health stats, including heart rate and HRV, as well as overnight blood oxygen and breathing rate.

The Oura Ring has been used in independent studies at UCSF, UC San Diego, MIT Lincoln Laboratory, the US Army, and the US Navy — with more already in the works. University of California, San Diego is using Oura Ring to look for patterns in heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV), combined with other vitals that may help identify the onset of pregnancy and/or help predict different pregnancy outcomes and progressions. A team of researchers at West Virginia University published a new study on the accuracy of consumer tools at measuring heart rate and HRV. The infrared photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor in the Oura Ring nearly matched performance with clinical-grade ECG and consistently outperformed other PPG tools.

Our products are designed to help you to track important aspects of your health like your daily habits, reproductive health, and the quality of your sleep – we understand that data does not get much more personal than this. That's why we firmly believe that you should be in charge when it comes to your personal data. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) is designed to provide you with the information you need to take control of your personal data, which is a fundamental aspect of empowering your health journey. Please take a moment to carefully review this Policy. About this privacy policy This Policy applies to processing of personal data by Oura Health Oy and Ouraring Inc. and its subsidiaries(collectively, "Oura") when you visit our web properties (“Sites”); use the Oura Ring with the Oura App, Oura on the Web, or use other Oura services (“Services”). Why does Oura process your personal data? The sections below explain the categories of personal data we collect and process, as well as the reasons we do so. You will also find information on our legal basis for processing your data, and our data sources. Device & application users Processing Purposes When you use Oura Services, we collect and processes your personal data for the following purposes: To Provide Oura Services We process personal data when you use our Services, such as to provide you with personalized insights about your readiness, sleep, activity, and other inferences about your health status. To Provide Customer Service We process personal data to provide customer service and manage our customer communication. For example, if you contact our virtual assistant with questions regarding your account, we may use the provided information to answer your questions, and for solving any issues you may have. To Protect Your Privacy We may process personal data regarding your use of the Services to protect your privacy. This may involve the use of privacy enhancing technologies and other privacy-protective techniques. When information is aggregated or anonymized, it is no longer personal data. To Improve Our Services We process personal data regarding your use of our Services to understand how you use our Services and how we can improve them. For example, we may process personal data to improve your user experience in the Oura App or to develop cutting-edge features to provide you with new insights about your health. When feasible, we do this using data that has been processed in a manner to protect your privacy, such as by pseudonymization. To Perform Analysis We may process personal data about human performance and wellbeing to benefit our users and improve the cutting-edge insights we provide with our Services. Some features of our Services may use third-party automated technology to provide a more personalized experience, and to give you comprehensive insights about your data. For example, our Services include intelligent features that may use the responses you provide to better personalize the Services. When feasible, we do this using data that has been processed in a manner to protect your privacy. To Market Services We process marketing-related personal data to provide online advertising and other marketing communications on behalf of Oura and our partners. For example, as explained more fully in our Cookie Policy , we use cookies and similar technologies on our website to create audiences for online advertisement. You can opt out of direct marketing communications from Oura. To Enable Third-party Integrations and Services We process personal data you provide to Oura to enable third party integrations, services, features, and offerings. For example, with your permission, our Services may integrate with third-party services like Google Health Connect and Apple HealthKit, or those of our partners. Oura takes measures to help ensure third-party services protect your personal data, which means that Oura only processes your data with respect to third-party integrations when you choose to integrate them with our Services, or when you provide the necessary consents. We process the data we receive from these third-parties according to applicable terms, such as the Google Health Connect Permissions policy and Google Limited Use requirements, as well as relevant third-party developer license agreements, as we become aware of those policies and agreements. To Comply with Legal Obligations In certain cases, we must process certain data when it is required by applicable laws and regulations. Such statutory obligations are related, for example, to accounting and tax requirements, legal claims, or other legal purposes. Oura will oppose any request to provide legal authorities with access to user data for surveillance or prosecution purposes. We will notify users if we receive any such request whenever legally permissible. Legal basis for processing Data protection law in Europe and the U.K. requires a "lawful basis" for collecting and retaining personal information from residents of the European Economic Area. Our lawful bases for processing your data depend on the particular processing purposes, including: Contract When processing personal data for the purpose of providing our Services, we process personal data on the basis of a user contract, which is formed when you create your account and accept our Terms of Use . Consent We process your sensitive personal data only with your consent. In some cases, you can provide your consent to us for processing your data through your actions, such as by adding sensitive personal data into your notes, or by adding health related tags in the Oura App. Legitimate Interest We process your personal data based on our legitimate interests when we process it for the purposes of marketing our Services and Sites, providing our customer service, and improving our Services. When choosing to use your personal data on the basis of our legitimate interests, we carefully weigh our own interests against your right to privacy, in compliance with applicable law. Legal Obligation Oura must process certain information to comply with statutory obligations which may vary in each country. For example, such obligations can relate to consumer protection or tax laws. Processed data and data source In most cases, Oura collects personal data directly from you, such as when you register for an account, tag your data in the Oura mobile or web app, or use your Oura Ring. We may also process personal data that is produced from the information you provide to us. Oura may also rely on trusted third-party processors to process data on our behalf, such as our cloud service providers. Oura processes the following personal data categories when you use our Services: Contact information such as email address or physical address. User information such as gender, height and weight, User ID, and other information you may provide to us about yourself or your account. Device information such as IP address and location data.

Please note that some of the personal data we process, including any data concerning your health, is considered special or sensitive personal data. Under applicable law, such data is processed only if you have given your consent for processing. If you access or use any of Oura's location-based services, such as by enabling GPS-based activity tracking through our Services, Oura may process the approximate or precise location of your device while the service is active. This data may be obtained via your device's service provider network ID, GPS, and/or Wi-Fi data. Oura does not process such location data without first obtaining your consent. You may disable such location processing at any time using your device's location permission settings. If you choose to disable access to location data, please note that certain Services, features, or functionalities may no longer be accessible. Please also note that if you give your opt-in consent through our Services, you may share limited personal information like your current and past sleep and readiness scores with other Oura users.

Depending on your use of our Services, you may also choose to communicate with and react to other users' information and scores. Please remember to always maintain a respectful and supportive environment when communicating with other users. Please see Oura's Terms of Use for more information. Oura Teams Oura Teams is a service that allows you to share your Oura Ring data with your doctor, coach, trainer, or other researchers (“Data Recipient”) which invite you to share your data. If you choose to participate in Oura Teams, once you consent to sharing your personal data with the Data Recipient, the data that you sync to your Oura App is available for the Data Recipient in Oura Teams. The Oura Teams service shows Teams administrators their team's statistics at a glance and allows them to get a detailed look into your data, such as heart rate, heart rate variability, activity level, and other data that you sync to your Oura App. Once your data is shared to the Oura Teams service, the Data Recipient becomes the controller of your personal data. The Data Recipient is responsible for its processing your personal data according to applicable laws. Your personal data is used by the Data Recipient in accordance with its own privacy policy, so please carefully review the Data Recipient's privacy policy carefully before opting-in to Oura Teams.

You can withdraw your consent via Oura on the Web ( here ) or from the settings menu on the Oura App. If you withdraw your consent, the Data Recipient can no longer access your data. Please note that withdrawing your consent from the service or changing any other consent settings do not affect the processing of data that the Data Recipient may have extracted from the Oura Teams service. Oura uses aggregated Oura Teams data for analytics, statistics, research and development purposes. Oura is the controller of such aggregated data, which may no longer qualify as personal data due to the aggregation. For other data Oura processes which are not at the direction of the Data Recipient, the rest of the terms in this Privacy Policy apply.

To Comply with Legal Obligations In certain cases, we must process certain personal data when it is required by applicable legislation. Such statutory obligations are related, for example, to accounting and tax requirements, legal claims, or other legal purposes.

If you choose to do this, you should carefully review the third-party consent language and privacy notices that are available to you from the third-party, which will control the use of your personal data. LEGAL FRAMEWORKS FOR INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS Oura is a global company with servers around the world, and your personal data may at times be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live.

Oura has further certified that we adhere to the principles of the Data Privacy Frameworks. Click https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/ to learn more about the Data Privacy Frameworks. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Policy and the Data Privacy Frameworks principles, the principles shall govern.

We may make changes to, suspend, or discontinue Paid Services at any time for any reason, and Oura reserves the sole discretion to determine which Services or portions thereof require payment. Paid Services may include pre-ordered Products that will be produced for you in the future (“Pre-Order”). You will be charged a Pre-Order fee when placing your Pre-Order. The actual date for shipping any accepted Pre-Order will depend on a variety of factors, including but not limited to, the date of payment of your Pre-Order fee and Oura's manufacturing schedule. There is no shipping date guarantee for Pre-Orders. You agree to pay all applicable fees for Paid Services including, without exclusion, any monthly subscription fees, user fees, and offering fees and any other fees, charges, or costs that you agree to purchase as part of the Paid Services during the checkout process (“Fees”).

At any time for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration (“credits”) to some or all of our users. The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future.

Your payment information will be processed and stored through a third-party payment processor. All paid account holders must maintain at least one valid payment method for payment of Fees, which are described in more detail during checkout. All Fees are calculated and billed to you on a monthly or annual basis depending upon your choice, and are due immediately upon receipt and are subject to change. You acknowledge that Fees have a recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. Fees shall be charged or debited from the saved, designated payment method you provide one day prior to the monthly or yearly anniversary of the initial purchase date.
